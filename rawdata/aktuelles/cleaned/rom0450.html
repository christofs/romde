The person appointed to the post will be obliged to complete a course in university teaching devised especially for assistant professors, and is expected to be able to take part in all the activities of the Department, including examinations and administration.

Furthermore, through their research, applicants are expected to contribute to the development of the degree programme and to the department´s Latin American profile.

Furthermore, the successful candidate will be expected to make a significant contribution to the department´s Centre for Latin American Studies.  The successful applicant must be well-versed in cultural and societal issues within the Portuguese-speaking world and must be able to relate to a multidisciplinary research and teaching perspective.
