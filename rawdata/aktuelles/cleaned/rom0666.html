<inhalt>           ISSEI, International Society for the Study of European Ideas Conference: The Ethical Challenge of Multidisciplinarity: Reconciling ‘The Three Narratives’—Art, Science, and Philosophy July 2 – 6, 2012  Section IV: Art, Theatre, Literature, Music, Culture <b>Workshop: 1912: The State of the French Novel before Proust</b>  Chair:    Jeffrey Johnson, Independent Scholar, New York, New York, USA marcha.jeff@verizon.net   2013 will be the centenary of the publication of Marcel Proust’s Du côté de chez Swann (Swann’s Way), the first volume of his remarkable novel A la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time) to be published. During the thirty years prior to the publication of this first volume, the French novel had been in a state of crisis. Beginning with the appearance of this first volume and continuing with the publication, after the First World War, of subsequent volumes of La Recherche, Proust’s novel provided confirmation of the viability and significance of the novel as a literary form.  Reviewing the works of writers during the period before 1913 will focus attention on the problems writers faced and the solutions they devised in working with the novel. The workshop’s goal will be to 1) identify these creative problems, 2) consider the results of writer’s efforts to deal with them, and 3) evaluate how their work led to the work of writers who came after or to the work they did later in their own careers. Among the writers whose names will likely come up are Paul Bourget, Pierre Loti, the pre-La Recherche Proust, Maurice Barrès, Anatole France, and André Gide. The work of many other writers going back to the late nineteenth century will find a place in this discussion as well. Papers on the works and influence of such thinkers as Henri Bergson and Henri Poincaré are also welcome.  If interested, please contact Jeff Johnson: marcha.jeff@verizon.net      </inhalt>
