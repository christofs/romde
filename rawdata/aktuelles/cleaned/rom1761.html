<inhalt>           <b>Die Einsendefrist für Vorträge / Poster zu dieser Tagung wird bis zum 28.02.2014 verlängert.</b>  The Department of Romance Languages and Literatures of the Philipps-Universität Marburg (Germany) invites PhD students and young researchers to submit proposals for 20-minute presentations or poster presentations for its interdisciplinary conference.   In recent years, Iberian Cultural Studies has been established as a transregional and interdisciplinary perspective within international Hispanic Cultural Studies. The main focus of interest is on the Iberian Peninsula as a cultural area that is characterized by the multipolarity and the positionality of different languages, literatures and cultures (Castilian, Portuguese, Catalan, Basque, and Galician). The First Conference of Iberian Cultural Studies (20th – 21st century) in Germany: Memories of Transition. Transitions of Memory will be held in conjunction with the Third International Seminar of the Network “Historical Memory and Iberian Literatures”. The conference seeks to bring together internationally recognized experts as well as young researchers working at German-speaking universities who are especially interested in Iberian Studies.   The principal theme of the conference will be the Peninsula’s period of democratization, namely the transición. This period was the most decisive step in the history of contemporary (Iberian) culture. It constitutes a process of cultural transformation towards an ambivalently perceived post-dictatorial present. As the Spanish Occupy movement and its critique of the so-called “cultura de la transición” (CT) have shown, the transición-period is still relevant nowadays. It serves as reference point in the discourse about the interpretation of the totalitarian past and the cultural ontology of the present. From a global point of view, the transición is an epochal, cultural paradigm, which suggests comparisons with other cultures. On the Iberian Peninsula, the multiple characteristics of the transición are refracted in the prism of different languages and cultures.  We welcome submissions from graduate students and young researchers in the fields of Romance Languages and Literatures, Cultural Studies, Anthropology, Political Science and other disciplines relevant to Iberian Cultural Studies.  (1) Papers: We invite papers that explore any literary, cultural or anthropological aspect connected to the culture of the transición from new perspectives.  (2) Poster session:  The purpose of the poster session is to allow PhD students and young researchers working on topics related to the transition OR to any other aspect connected to Iberian Cultural Studies (20th – 21st century) to present their ideas/projects.  PhD students and young researchers interested in participating in this conference, are invited to submit a one-page proposal and a CV (.doc, .docx, or .pdf format) by February 21, 2014. In your proposal, please include a paper / poster title, an abstract, and a very brief statement indicating your academic interests, and any audio-visual requirements for the presentation. Proposals can be submitted in any of the conference languages.  Conference languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Galician and English.  Confirmed plenary speakers include: Joan Ramon Resina (Stanford University) Xosé Manoel Núñez Seixas (LMU München) Vicente Sánchez-Biosca (Universitat de València)  Please send abstracts to Ulrich Winter: winteru@staff.uni-marburg.de  The deadline for submissions is February 21, 2014. Confirmation of acceptance will be sent by March 5, 2014.  Presentations will be 20 minutes followed by questions.   Questions can be addressed to Ulrich Winter: winteru@staff.uni-marburg.de  For more information (venue, accommodation, etc.), please visit our website: <a href="http://iberianculturalstudies.weebly.com/" target="_blank" >iberianculturalstudies.weebly.com</a>      </inhalt>
