<inhalt>           Call for Contributions  (welcome in English, French, Spanish, or Portuguese)  Nadja Gernalzick (Oldenburg/Mainz) and Gabriele Pisarz-Ramírez (Leipzig), eds.  Cuban Transfers  with an introductory essay by Ottmar Ette  In 1940, Spanish-trained Cuban ethnologist and sociologist Fernando Ortíz intervened in the debate on cultural contact in the transatlantic space and between Europe, Africa, and the Americas with the proposition of the concept of transculturación to capture a specifically Cuban experience and history of violent cultural contact. The sociologists' debate was then led by Melville J. Herskovits and Franklin Frazier from the U.S. and by Bronisłav K. Malinowski, Ortíz was supported by Malinowski and positioned his concept of transculturación against composite conceptualizations working with the terms deculturation and acculturation in the description of the process of cultural migration.   The collection Cuban Transfers takes this discursive node as a starting point for investigations of the past and the present of Cuban culture and cultural production in transatlantic interchange with Europe and the Americas. We invite contributions which explore e.g. the role of Cuba and Cubans as images of alterity in U.S. political and cultural discourse since the colonial period, the exchanges between Cuban intellectuals, writers, and artists with Europe and the Americas especially since the 19th century, the history of Cuba and its transatlantic relations as manifest in circumatlantic literatures and cultures, slavery in Cuba in comparison, the role of filibustero newspapers edited by exiled Cubans in the U.S. such as El Mulato, La Verdad, or El Independiente, Cuban-American 'radio wars,' the international disciplinary debates with their ramifications into postcolonial studies that involve Cuban intellectuals and artists or evolve around Cuban themes, Cuba as a place of refuge for exiled intellectuals, politicians, and artists, aspects of Cuban diaspora, Guantánamo and the history of concentration camps on Cuba, or Cuba and capitalism, communism, socialism, Ché-ism.  Approaches to the works should be interested in the 'inter' or 'trans' of cultures, media, disciplines, and nations. We are also particularly looking for contributions on the visual, performing, or musical arts. We expressly welcome contributions in Spanish, French, and Portuguese.
