It has particular strengths in Dante and 20th-century culture.  Applications will be considered from researchers in any area of Italian studies prior to 20th Century, although preference may be given to candidates with expertise in the early modern period, or in other areas that supplement the department's current scope.  You will have completed a PhD, and have a well-defined profile in research and publication. You may have an interdisciplinary approach to teaching, and will have a high level of expertise in Italian language, with the ability to contribute where required to Italian-language instruction at any level.
