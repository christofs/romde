<inhalt>           AHRC PhD fully funded Studentship The Italian Academies 1525-1700: The First Intellectual Networks Of Early Modern Europe University of Reading   The University of Reading is pleased to be able to offer a Doctoral Studentship, fully funded by the AHRC (UK/EU rate), covering the period 1st October 2010 to 30th September 2013. The successful applicant will be supervised by Dr Lisa Sampson at the Department of Italian Studies, one of the largest and most prestigious of its kind in the country with an outstanding record in teaching and research. The student will form part of an established, interdisciplinary project team with partners at Royal Holloway, London (PI Professor Jane Everson, two Post-doctoral Research Assistants), the British Library (Co-I Denis Reidy) and the University of Reading (Co-I Dr Lisa Sampson).  The PhD will focus particularly on the cultural politics of the academies in Ferrara and Mantua, drawing initially on the resources and methodology operative for the database that forms the basis for the current project (http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/ItalianAcademies/ ).  Training at the British Library in research for the database and in archival work is envisaged during the course of the studentship, and the studentship will thereafter involve independent research in Italy.  Applications are invited from candidates holding an MA or equivalent in an appropriate subject area, with a native or near native command of Italian, and experience of studying Early Modern culture.   Further information on the studentship and on the application procedure is available from the website: <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/research/res-pgr-degrees/FundingOpportunities/res-pgstudarts.aspx" target="_blank" >www.reading.ac.uk/research/res-pgr-degrees/FundingOpportunities/res-pgstudarts.aspx</a>  For informal inquiries please email Dr Lisa Sampson (l.m.sampson@reading.ac.uk)  Deadline for applications: 11 June 2010     </inhalt>
