<inhalt>           DICA-lab within the Unit for Socio-Cultural Research on Learning and Development, University of Luxembourg invites researchers and practitioners, who focus on learning and development from social and activity-driven perspectives, to submit abstracts to the international conference “Methodologies and Practices for Approaching Learning as a Social Phenomenon Inside and Outside of School”.  The international conference, which is kindly sponsored by Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg (FNR), takes place at the University of Luxembourg, campus Walferdange December 10th -12th 2008.  Since the 1990s, a growing amount of research has adopted socio-cultural and/or interactional approaches to describe and analyze learning and development. These approaches contrast previous research, which has been primarily (i) conducted from a psychological/psycholinguistic approach, and (ii) focused on learning and development as exclusively a matter for the individual('s mind). As opposed to this view, more socially based studies argue that learning is intrinsically (i) social in nature, (ii) situated in a particular local context, and (iii) does not only occur in formal settings.  The conference focuses on formal as well as informal learning. Of particular relevance is the inclusion of visual, or “multimodal”, aspects of language, and as such the conference will discuss benefits and challenges of including multimodal and activity-bound aspects for the analysis of learning and development.  The following scholars will present keynote lectures:  - Gabriele Pallotti, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia - Donald Carroll, Shikoku Gakuin University - Pilar Lacasa, University of Alcalá - Reinhold Schmitt, University of Mannheim - Catherine E. Brouwer, University of Southern Denmark  Thematically, papers and presentations should address one or more of the following domains  - Plurilingual learning in and through interaction - Multimodal interaction as analytic tool for learning or multimodal learning? - Education in plurilingual societies – social perspectives of development - Classroom interaction – social interaction and multimodality  Theoretically and methodologically, the conference invites researchers from a broader range of fields to participate. These are sociocultural research, activity theory and an array of interactional approaches.  Two presentation/submission formats have been designed for allowing exchanges and the discussion across frameworks: Paper sessions and round poster sessions, bringing together genuine work from both theoretical and applied research perspectives.  Abstracts for presentations (in English) will undergo a blind double peer-review and should be sent to learning08@multi-learn.org by October 1st. Pre-submission, consisting of name, affiliation and title of paper proposal, should be sent by September 15th. Notification of accepted abstracts will be sent out shortly after the submission deadline. Bilingual (including English as one presentational mode) presentations are encouraged.
