<inhalt>           The Faculty, in association with St Peter's College, is seeking to appoint an individual from 1 October 2013 or as soon as possible thereafter to provide teaching and research in the area of Medieval French.  Oxford University has the largest concentration of scholars working in the Medieval period in the UK, and the appointee will be able to interact with specialists in all other areas and periods of medieval studies.  The appointee will be expected to give no fewer than thirty-six lectures or classes on Medieval French and an average of six hours per week of tutorial teaching in French and Medieval French each year, as well as engaging in independent research and participating in examining, admissions and other administrative duties as required by the Faculty and college.  Applicants should possess: a PhD/DPhil in French (with a significant emphasis on the Medieval period), a successful track record of teaching at undergraduate level, and an understanding of undergraduate and graduate needs and how to address them, and a strong research record in Medieval French, appropriate to the stage of the individual's career.  Further information, which all applicants should consult, is available in the further particulars available when following the link above.     </inhalt>
