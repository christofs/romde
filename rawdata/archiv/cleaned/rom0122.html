<inhalt>           The Gulbenkian Doctoral Program at the Institute for Romance Philology is a highly competitive postgraduate educational format to encourage outstanding international students to pursue a dissertation in the field of Portuguese Literature and Culture at the Institute for Romance Philology at Freie Universität Berlin.  The Program offers three years of funding and an intensive and individual supervision of a dissertation in the field of Portuguese Literature and Culture. The objective of the Program is to encourage research on the unique constellations of Portuguese Culture beyond national boundaries and to approach literature as a privileged discourse across political, institutional and social limitations. Doctoral candidates take part in several activities designed to support them in their research within their individual disciplines, but at the same time also placing this research in an interdisciplinary context. These activities include Research colloquia with renowned visiting academics and seminars on Portuguese Literature and Culture, Methodology and Literary Theory.  The Gulbenkian Doctoral Program accepts only applications from students of outstanding promise, as evidenced by their academic records, statement of purpose, and writing sample. Students applying for such a scholarship must hold an M.A. degree in literature, cultural history or a related field and will be admitted to the Ph.D. program on the basis of an evaluation of their record by an admissions committee consisting of outstanding scholars of Portuguese and Comparative Literary Studies. A writing sample of literary criticism is required for the Ph.D. program. It may be a term paper, a master’s thesis, or a published article and should be written in English, Portuguese or German.  Applications must be submitted by September 25th, 2012. The program will begin in November 2012.  Please submit the following documents: A statement of purpose containing an outline of a possible dissertation project (5–7 pages), a curriculum vitae, an outline of academic records, certified copies of all academic degrees acquired, a writing sample of your academic work (15-20 pages), a letter of recommendation. Please send your application to the following address:  Freie Universität Berlin Institut für Romanische Philologie Frau Prof. Dr. Susanne Zepp Habelschwerdter Allee 45 14195 Berlin - Germany      </inhalt>
