<inhalt>           XXIV INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF ONOMASTIC SCIENCES Barcelona, 5th - 9th September 2011  Names in daily life Call opened till 15 december 2010  SECTION 1. TERMINOLOGY President: Julia Kuhn / Advisers: Isolde Hausner, Mats Wahlberg  Terminological rigour is often taken as a measure of how far a science   has progressed. A strict application of terms is a necessary tool in all scientific communication.  Papers presenting overall terminological questions, the situation   within various branches of onomastics (place -names, personal names and other types of names) or in a certain country are welcome. The work in this section should focus on problems concerning ambiguous and inconsistent use of onomastic terms, the need for new terms or deletion of old   terms, etc., rather than on contributions with a mere describing purpose.   Concrete terminological problems in connection with classification and structural analysis of different types of names are also important to discuss. Terminological discrepancies between different languages and countries   sometimes make the international communication between onomasticians difficult. ICOS wants to take up the challenge to work on the elaboration of a list of basic onomastic terms for international use. The ICOS Terminology Group is therefore currently engaged in creating such a   list in the three official languages of ICOS, English, French and German.   Papers focusing on problems related to mutual understanding of onomastic terms on an international level are especially welcome as a means of promoting the work within this group and opening a broad discussion   for all interested ICOS members.  Subtopics: 1. Overall terminological questions 2. Terminological problems within various branches of onomastics 3. Terminological problems in connection with classification and structural analysis of different types of names 4.
