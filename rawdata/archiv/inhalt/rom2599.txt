The School invites applications for two PhD studentships, available to UK/EU students who wish to undertake doctoral study in the School of Modern Languages (French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish and Latin American Studies, Cultural Identity Studies). To be considered for these studentships, students must register between 1st September and 15th October 2009.  Each studentship is worth £7,000 per year, for a period of three years of full-time doctoral study, or to be adapted accordingly for part time study. This amount will pay tuition fees (currently £3,400 per year for Home/EU students), with the remainder of the sum contributing to maintenance.
