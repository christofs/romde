           We are pleased to announce the organization of an international conference on  The Mediterranean in Italian Culture  to be held in the cities of Venice and Udine on May 3 and 4, 2010  The purpose of this conference is to explore the role that the Mediterranean, conceived as a unique set of cultural ferments, has played in the history of Italian culture from the Middle Ages to the present.  The conference is meant to have a broad spectrum and to generate interdisciplinary discussion on fundamental aspects of the Mediterranean heritage in the intellectual, linguistic, and artistic history of the Italian peninsula.   We are interested in papers concerned with the interpretation of  specific historical events, linguistic documents, literary texts, and works of art  in the context of  ideas of the Mediterranean  in contemporary culture. Papers on the Mediterranean aspects of the culture of Venice throughout history will be especially welcome.
