Jornadas Europeias do Património / European Heritage Days in Portugal
           Once a year, several countries in Europe celebrate Europe's heritage. The initiative of the European Heritage Days was launched in the 1990's as a joint action of the Council of Europe and the European Commission. The events held by several institutions in different countries highlight local skills, traditions, art, but the main goal is to raise the awareness of citizens to the patrimonial richness and cultural diversity in Europe and, in particular, to its importance and preservation.   Centro Interdisciplinar de Documentação Linguística e Social (CIDLeS) will participate in the European Heritage Days in Portugal, this year dedicated to the theme &quot,The Future of Memory&quot,. CIDLeS will organize several activities, such as talks, workshops, seminars, thematic visits, and film projections that focus on the documentation and preservation of cultural and linguistic traditions.
