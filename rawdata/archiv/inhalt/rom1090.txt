CfP: Second Workshop â€œExperimental Phonetics and Sound Change (with special reference to the Romance languages)
           We invite submission of abstracts for poster presentation at the Second Workshop on Sound Change to be held on March 20th, 2012 at the University of Salamanca. The goal of this series of workshops is to gather scholars working on the phonetic and phonological factors involved in the implementation of sound change.  Abstracts may report experimental and/or non-experimental data on sound change dealing preferably with one or several Romance languages. They should not exceed one page (tables, graphs and references can be on a separate page), and should be submitted electronically as a .pdf file to fsmiret@usal.es before September 30, 2011. Accepted abstracts will be posted on the workshop website.
