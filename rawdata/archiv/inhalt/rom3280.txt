Visiting Fellowships 2012-2013
           Visiting Fellowships 2012-2013 University of Oxford - All Souls College, Oxford  The College proposes to elect a number of Visiting Fellows, for periods of one, two, or three terms, in the academic year October 2012 to June 2013. These Fellowships are intended to enable their holders to carry out study and research in Oxford and to participate in the academic life of the College and the University. Visiting Fellowships are open in all subjects. Applications will be considered from staff of any university or other institution of higher learning, from other suitably qualified persons who wish to carry out full-time scholarly work in Oxford, and from those in public life (e.g. law, public policy, or the arts). In making its final choice, the College will give weight to intellectual quality, to the interest and feasibility of the research project, and to the relevance of residence in Oxford. It is not the College's policy to offer Visiting Fellowships to persons holding posts in Oxford or already resident in, or near, Oxford.  There is no stipend, but Visiting Fellows will be entitled to accommodation, a study in College, and lunches and dinners without charge. Limited financial subvention may also be offered in exceptional circumstances. Any candidate desiring to take advantage of this provision should indicate this at the appropriate point in the online application form.  Application should be made online in the 'Appointments' section of the main college website, www.all-souls.ox.ac.uk. Please contact the Fellows' Secretary if you have difficulty with applying online. Applications must be received by Friday, 2 September 2011. Contact: Fellows' Secretary, All Souls College, Oxford, OX1 4AL, tel. (01865) 279308, email: fellows.secretary@all-souls.ox.ac.uk.
