Graduate Program "Intercultural Humanities"
           The Graduate Program (MA and PhD) Intercultural Humanities at Jacobs University Bremen is a unique and innovative combined graduate program in Literature, History, History and Theory of Art with a special emphasis on intercultural encounters, cross-cultural transfers, cultural comparison, and transcultural universals. The program provides students with insights into the theories and methods used to investigate and describe inter- and transcultural processes and phenomena. Students become acquainted with the particularities of research in History, History and Theory of Art, and Literature as well as with interdisciplinary approaches applied in intercultural studies in the humanities. By studying exemplary cases of intercultural encounters, cross-cultural transfers and transcultural universals students learn how these theories and methods are applied in each of the fields and, in a second step, across the fields.  The program addresses intercultural and transcultural issues such as:  -	Why do authors write multilingual poems?  -	Which traces of colonialism can be found in the life of an Indian student today?  -	How are cultural conflicts reflected in aesthetics?  -	How did globalization start in China?  -	How does the global arts market affect the work of an artist in Cameroon?  -	What cultures regard violence as being beautiful?  -	How can cultural theories be applied to the intercultural interaction on the campus of an international university?
