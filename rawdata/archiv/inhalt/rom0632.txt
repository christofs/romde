CfA: Journal call for contributions (New Readings)
           Colleagues are warmly invited to submit contributions for volume 13 of New Readings, to be published no later than 31 August 2013. Contributions should be received by 31 August 2012, so that the editorial decision can be communicated before 30 November 2012.  New Readings is a peer-reviewed, open-access e-journal publishing original research in the fields of European literature, cultural history, film and visual culture. European here is understood as broadly as possible in terms of its geographical spread and its linguistic base. Francophone Africa and the Americas, for example, are therefore included in the journal's scope. The journal has a strong, but by no means exclusive interest in publishing papers which examine the links between Europe and the wider world, and in interdisciplinary scholarship.  Manuscripts should be prepared in accordance with the conventions of MLA style, as specified in MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers (7th edition, 2009) or MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing (3rd edition, 2008). The recommended word-count for submissions is 6,000-8,000 (including footnotes and Works Cited).  Further details about the journal can be found on the New Readings homepage: ojs.cf.ac.uk/index.php/newreadings/index Please note that submission is directly through the New Readings website: ojs.cf.ac.uk/index.php/newreadings/information/authors  Best wishes, Liz Wren-Owens Tilmann Altenberg General Editors, New Readings
