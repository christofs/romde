Each scholarship is worth £8,000 per year, for a period of three years (subject to satisfactory progress) of full-time doctoral study, or to be adapted accordingly for part time study. This amount will pay for home/EU tuition fees (currently £3,732 per year), with the remainder of the sum contributing to maintenance. To be considered for the scholarships, candidates must have registered by 31 August 2011.
