Visiting Fellowships 2011-12 
           Visiting Fellowships 2011-12 at the Institute of Germanic &amp, Romance Studies  School of Advanced Study, University of London  The Institute of Germanic &amp, Romance Studies [IGRS] offers both stipendiary and non-stipendiary Visiting Fellowships (for postdoctoral and advanced academics) and Junior Visiting Fellowships (for doctoral students) in the academic year 2011-12.  The IGRS was established in 2004 with the merger of the Institute of Germanic Studies (founded 1950) and the Institute of Romance Studies (founded 1989). It is one of the ten Institutes of the University of London's School of Advanced Study. Its purpose is to promote and facilitate the study of the cultures of countries speaking French, German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese across all the disciplines of the humanities. It runs seminars, conferences, guest lectures, research degrees and research training, publication series, a journal and fellowships within these fields.  The IGRS has four Research Centres:  ·       The Centre for the Study of Cultural Memory,  ·       The Centre for the Study of Contemporary Women’s Writing,  ·       The Ingeborg Bachmann Centre for Austrian Literature,  ·       The Research Centre for German and Austrian Exile Studies.

Fellows are offered shared office space with wifi access plus photocopying and computer facilities, free access to IGRS events and a Senate House library card for the period of their stay. IGRS Junior Visiting Fellows are, in addition, invited to attend IGRS research training seminars and any other activities specific to postgraduates.  All Visiting Fellows of the Institute are expected to complete a brief report on the research undertaken during their stay, to give, if time in London allows it, a seminar as part of the IGRS Work-in-Progress seminar series, and to contribute a recent, normally unpublished piece of work to our e-repository, SAS-Space.
