CfP: 46th Annual Meeting of the Societas Linguistica Europaea (SLE 2013)
           The study of discourse markers has become an important domain in Romance Linguistics. However, studies on the role of discourse markers in the learning and teaching of Romance languages as L2 have begun only ten years ago. Sometimes considered as the most ‘malicious’ elements of second language learning, discourse markers represent a challenge both for linguists and teachers. Therefore, the study of the process of discourse marker acquisition appears to be particularly interesting. The workshop aims at advancing the study in this field gathering researchers working on discourse markers in Romance languages as well as on the L2 acquisition of oral competence.   Abstracts should not exceed 500 words (exclusive of references) and should clearly state research questions, approach, method, data and (expected) results.
