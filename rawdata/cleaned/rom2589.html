<inhalt>           PhD &amp, Master Programs, Department of French and Francophone Studies, Pennsylvania State University, USA.  The Department of French and Francophone Studies at The Pennsylvania State University is recruiting well-qualified candidates for advanced study leading to the MA and PhD degrees. Since our program is selective, we are able to provide all of our full-time students with financial support and full tuition grants. We welcome applicants from historically underrepresented minorities, for whom additional internal fellowships are often available.   Penn State’s French and Francophone Studies’ graduate program is unique for having designed long-established PhD specializations in Civilization and Literature with an interdisciplinary orientation that fosters innovative approaches and offers a wide range of objects of study. Faculty expertise spans early-modern studies, theatre and film studies, colonial history and Francophone studies, material culture and aesthetics, cultural theory, popular and media cultures, and Jewish studies. In addition, our offerings include courses in linguistics (syntactic theory) as well as pedagogical training. We also offer a distinctive dual degree in French and Women’s Studies. Our thriving department provides a supportive environment in which faculty members dedicate themselves to the intellectual and professional development of graduate students. With over twenty graduate students in residence and fifteen full-time committed faculty members, each student receives individual attention and consistent mentoring. As a result, the Department has done very well with placement throughout the years.  Each year the program, along with partnering departments across the university, welcomes distinguished scholars from home and abroad, who contribute to the intellectual diversity of Penn State’s academic culture. Grants to support our students’ conference travel and dissertation research are available through a variety of internal sources. In addition, the Department offers the opportunity to participate in year-long graduate exchange programs with Université Marc-Bloch (Strasbourg II) and Université Lumière (Lyon II).  Penn State is recognized as a prominent institution of higher education and research, and is a member of the Association of American Universities, American Research Association, Universities Research Association, Big Ten Conference and World University Network. Penn State’s libraries are also ranked among the top public libraries in the US, and are generously endowed in the areas of French and Francophone Studies.
