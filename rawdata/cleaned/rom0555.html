<inhalt>           Birmingham is committed to attracting the brightest and the best from around the world to develop their academic careers at the University. We are making a major investment to recruit post-doctoral fellows of the very highest calibre.  We are conducting a global search to recruit up to 50 Birmingham Fellows.  The Birmingham Fellows will be outstanding post-doctoral researchers who are on a trajectory to become the next generation of research and academic leaders. The Birmingham Fellowships have been designed to support the Fellows as they establish themselves as rounded and mature academics at the University of Birmingham.  The Fellowships will be five-year appointments, giving the Fellows the time they need to engage in serious research and to establish themselves within the academic community at Birmingham, nationally and internationally.   Our goal with the Birmingham Fellowships is to cultivate the next generation of Birmingham academics, rather than to work with outstanding post-docs for a few years and then lose them from our community. Therefore, Fellows who meet their potential and perform according to the expectations agreed at the beginning of their fellowship term will be offered a permanent post at the end of the fellowship term.  Although research-focused, Fellows will be appointed to research and teaching contracts, reflecting our commitment to teaching as an integral part of an academic career. At the start of the Fellowship period, the emphasis will be on consolidating an already-outstanding research trajectory, but Fellows will be expected to engage in PhD supervision and to develop a growing teaching portfolio over their five-year term. Fellows will not be expected to engage in substantive academic management or administration during their Fellowship term.  Fellows will have access to start-up support and will receive mentoring and development support throughout their Fellowship. Fellows will be part of an interdisciplinary cohort that we intend will number as many as 50 by the time we have completed recruitment.  The University has identified over 20 priority areas for recruitment, reflecting particular concentrations of excellence. However, Birmingham is a comprehensive institution and this list reflects only a fraction of our research excellence. Outstanding candidates in other fields are welcome to apply as long as they can demonstrate how their work will complement and enhance excellence at the University of Birmingham.  Applications from candidates with external funding they would bring to Birmingham are particularly welcome. These candidates will be fast-tracked. See ‘Applying for the scheme’ for further information.  Applications are welcome from candidates in the UK and overseas who meet the criteria. Individuals currently at the University are also welcome to apply.
