<inhalt>           In order to support cultural historical research and encourage scholars in their early career, the International Society for Cultural History, ISCH, has decided to launch an essay prize which will be awarded each year to the best article on cultural history. The ISCH Prize in 2011 is 250 £. In the future, the winning article will also be published in the society's journal. The ISCH welcomes original texts that make an insightful contribution to scholarship on cultural history through methodological innovation, theoretical originality or historiographical significance. Articles on any aspect of cultural history, on any historical period or geographical area will be accepted for consideration.  Submissions should be original, unpublished works in English or French, written by scholars who, when applying for the prize, are either preparing their PhD or have completed their PhD during the last five years. Essays should be double spaced, and no more than 7000 words in length.  To submit an entry, please send a complete application to each member of the Prize Committee. Electronic submissions are not accepted. The submissions should include a cover sheet with author information, the essay and its publication details and a short CV. Your submission must be postmarked not later than by 30 May 2010. The winner will be announced at the ISCH Conference in Oslo, 3-6 August 2011.
