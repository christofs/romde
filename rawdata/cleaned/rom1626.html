<inhalt>           Important work in the humanities is taking place where law and literature intersect: in the study of hate speech under the rubric of performative language, in the study of copyright and intellectual property law as part of the material culture of literature, in the study of forensic genres of literature, from revenge tragedy to the contemporary policier. What can literature tell us about the law? How does literature evoke the law to illuminate other subjects? In which ways do the two influence one another? What points of reference enable, or delimit, their interactions?  The 2011 Forum Prize competition invites submissions on the subject of Literature and the Law, addressing literature of any period, and in any of the languages covered by the journal (usually English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian, but we will consider others too). The competition is open to all researchers, whether established or early-career: it is worth noting that previous competitions have been won by scholars in both categories.  <b>The Forum Prize</b> The winner's prize will consist of: 1. Publication of the winning essay in the next appropriate volume of Forum for Modern Language Studies 2. A cash prize of £200 Other entries of sufficient quality may be invited to publish.
