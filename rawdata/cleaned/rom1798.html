These workshops are open to all and we welcome participation by all those interested in early modern Italy and in the history of the book in early modern Europe, and by librarians, curators and palaeographers. There is a small number of postgraduate bursaries to cover all or part of the cost of attendance. There is no charge for attendance but space is limited.
