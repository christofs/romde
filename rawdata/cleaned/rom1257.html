<inhalt>           Clitics are often phonologically reduced forms with a special paradigmatic and/or syntactic distribution compared to other parts of speech (e.g., free pronouns). Therefore, clitics are studied from quite different linguistic perspectives. E.g., while phonologists are interested in prosodic questions about clitics at the interface between phonology and syntax, morphologists and syntacticians usually investigate the paradigmatic and/or linear distribution of clitics with respect to morphosyntactic features and to syntactic rules of well-formedness. One characteristic, however, that concerns all linguistic perspectives mentioned here, is the explicit or at least implicit interest in the interaction between different components of the grammar, since clitics are a locus classicus for interface studies. Therefore, the workshop tries to bring together linguists working on clitics and related grammatical parts of speech (e.g., functional words, particles, etc.) from diverse research fields. We welcome submissions addressing clitics and related expressions from various perspectives such as phonology and prosody, morphology, syntax, semantics, information structure, typology, historical linguistics, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, and computational linguistics.   Submission: We invite abstracts for 35-minute presentation (plus 10 minutes for discussion). Abstracts should be anonymous and not exceed two pages, including examples and references.
