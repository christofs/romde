<inhalt>           Subject to final approval from university authorities, the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy at Ghent University (Belgium) will soon advertize two tenure-track positions as ‘docent’ (equivalent of Lecturer in the UK system and Assistant Professor in the US system) with a focus on academic research. The advertisement will include four disciplines, the two posts will be awarded to the candidates most likely to contribute to the Faculty’s strong research profile. The Department of Literary Studies wants to draw attention to the vacancy in European literature from Antiquity to 1900, and asks potential candidates to get in touch now, so as to receive detailed instructions on application deadlines and procedures as soon as that information is available.   Applications from individuals with expertise in any European literature taught in the department (Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Latin, Portuguese, Spanish, Scandinavian) and any period prior to 1900 will be considered. Applications from individuals with transhistorical, transnational, translingual or interdisciplinary research interests are particularly welcome. This may include but is not limited to: - publications or research plans that cover more than one period (for example, studies tracing the development of a concept, trope or textual tradition from antiquity through the Middle Ages or the reception of Classical works in the early modern period). - publications or research plans that cover more than one national or language tradition (comparative approaches, the study of influence and imitation across borders, etc.) - publications or research plans that create bridges to other departments and disciplines (history, art history, archaeology, history of science, law, philosophy, etc.) - publications or research plans that involve innovative methodologies (for example, New Philology, New Historicism, Digital Humanities, history of the book, textual materialism, stylometry, computational philology)  The successful candidate will play a central role in the organization of the new two-year M.A. programme in Historical Linguistics and Literature (ancient, medieval and early modern). This M.A. programme teaches students to decipher texts from earlier periods and to situate them in their wider historical, social, cultural and philosophical context. Coursework focuses on diachronic linguistics, techniques of textual analysis, history of ideas and cultural history as well as period-specific topics in the various languages taught in the department. For more information on the programme, see: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/75hqxvw" target="_blank" >tinyurl.com/75hqxvw</a>   The successful candidate will also contribute to one or more of the following interdisciplinary research groups at the university: - GICS: Ghent Institute for Classical Studies: <a href="http://www.giks.ugent.be" target="_blank" >www.giks.ugent.be</a> - Henri Pirenne Institute for Medieval Studies: <a href="http://www.pirenne.ugent.be" target="_blank" >www.pirenne.ugent.be</a>  - GEMS: Group for Early Modern Studies: <a href="http://www.gems.ugent.be" target="_blank" >www.gems.ugent.be</a> - Centre for the Study of Text and Print Culture: <a href="http://www.print-culture.ugent.be" target="_blank" >www.print-culture.ugent.be</a>  The successful candidate will play a role in coordinating research collaborations across the language groups and research periods within the department and in establishing bridges between the department and other research units both at the University and beyond. Collaborations could include the development of new course offerings or programmes of study (for example, through Erasmus Mundus) or larger research projects (for example, through HERA: www.heranet.info).   Candidates should have earned their PhD at least two years prior to the date of appointment (set for 1 February 2013, with 1 October 2013 as a negotiable alternative). They should be developing a strong publication profile in their field and should be able to contribute appropriately to the periodical research evaluation of the department. The university values highly research published in international, peer-reviewed venues, particularly in journals included in the Web of Science. The successful candidate will be expected to take an active role in research and have an interest in putting together collaborative projects capable of attracting external funding at both the regional and European level.   This is a tenure-track position. At the time of appointment, the lecturer and the university will agree upon a set of personalized goals, which will be laid out in an addendum to the tenure-track contract. After a five-year trial period, the lecturer will be granted tenure and promoted to Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) provided that s/he has met these goals.  Candidates are encouraged to clarify in their applications not only their past research and publications but also their future research plans and how they might collaborate with research groups and with colleagues both inside and outside the department. It is recommended that candidates give as much detail as possible about future projects and plans including possible sources of funding and the venues to which research will be submitted.  The Department of Literary Studies at UGent (http://tinyurl.com/d4c34nb) is a vibrant community of 168 people, including some 50 fully funded PhD-students and 20 postdocs, the professor will join 27 colleagues specialising in nine languages as well as General and Comparative Literature. Tenure-track and tenured faculty at Ghent University enjoy an autonomous status, competitive salaries, relatively light teaching loads and a wealth of funding opportunities at the local, regional and European levels. Ghent is an attractive medieval town, with a strong economic base and lively cultural scene. Just 30 minutes by train from Brussels, two hours from Paris and Amsterdam and two and a half hours from London, it is moreover ideally situated at the heart of European intellectual life.   Ghent University is committed to internationalization and welcomes applications from foreign scholars. Knowledge of Dutch is not necessary to apply, but candidates should be willing to learn the language. The International Staff Office assists with the transition and orientation of foreign employees.  The deadline for application is likely to be 15 August 2012 (subject to confirmation), but candidates are advised to get in touch with the contact persons. Formal information on how to apply and the official announcement of the position (including confirmed deadline) will be available at: <a href="http://www.ugent.be/en/news/vacancies/autonomous" target="_blank" >www.ugent.be/en/news/vacancies/autonomous</a>  Enquiries are encouraged and may be emailed to Prof. Dr. Gert Buelens (Gert.Buelens@UGent.be), Chair of the Department of Literary Studies, and Prof. Dr. Jürgen Pieters (Jurgen.Pieters@UGent.be).       </inhalt>
