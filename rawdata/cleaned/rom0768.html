Politeness plays a central role in human behaviour as a form of indirect communication which can be used to persuade or to downplay power strategies. This universal behaviour, which can be observed in all societies but is at the same time difficult to delimit and comprehend, has become the object of study in a wide range of fields, such as literary and artistic studies, history, sociology and linguistics.  Politeness regulates human interactions and contributes to social balance, and its real, virtual or hidden forms have been constantly present in all discourses, from the political to the pedagogic, from ancient times to our own cyberlanguage age.  The aim of this conference is to promote exchanges and dialogue among various disciplines and approaches. Thus, we invite researchers from different fields to reflect on the fundamental nature of politeness as a strategy to shorten distances between ourselves and others and to highlight the essential value of verbal and social codes/rules in the construction of sociability.  The conference will be organized into plenary sessions with guest speakers and parallel sessions, for which we invite you to submit your proposals for papers.  The abstract can be written in Portuguese, English, French or Spanish and should include the following elements:  a) full title of presentation/paper, b) abstract (maximum 300 words), c) author or authors of the paper, d) affiliation or research center, e) email address, f) short curriculum vitae  (maximum 100 words).   The deadline for proposals submission is May 10, 2012 Notification of acceptance decisions will be communicated via email by June 10, 2012  Abstracts should be sent by email as a Word attachment to: cortesia2012@gmail.com      </inhalt>
