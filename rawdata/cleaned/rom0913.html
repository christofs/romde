<inhalt>           ‘Italian Sexualities Uncovered’ Workshop, the University of Bologna, in collaboration with Birkbeck University of London and the University of Queensland, 21-22 September 2012, Bologna, Italy.    This workshop aims to gather innovative research on the history of sexuality in Italy during the long 19th century and to create a forum of debate between scholars working within and outside of Italy, especially, but not exclusively, in Britain and English speaking countries. While the early modern Italian history of sexuality has been explored, and in recent years scholars from a number of disciplines have written in a variety of ways about the twentieth century history of sexuality in Italy, the history of the nineteenth century has been generally overlooked. This workshop wishes to attract papers that address new and provocative questions about the Italian history of sexualities from 1789-1914.  Proposals are invited on any aspect of legislative, social and cultural influences on sexuality, and topics might include: state, religious and political attempts to shape and intervene in individuals’ sexual life, history of birth control and abortion, courtship, marriage and divorce, sexual variations, including homosexuality, sex education, adultery, prostitution and the sex trade, sexual geographies (sexualities in the cities and rural areas, northern and southern Italy), illegitimacy, shifting notions of morality, sexual identities, femininity and masculinity, pornography, censorship and morality crusades, sexual abuse, sexual violence, and incest. We are also interested in contributions that focus on British and Italian transnational history of sexuality, topics might include: British (homo)sexual tourism in places such as Capri, Naples, Venice,  British perceptions of Italian sexual habits, perceptions of different sexual attitudes between the British and Italian, British and Italian sexual encounters.   Junior scholars engaged in new research are particularly encouraged to submit proposals. Ideally participants should be able to read and speak both Italian and English, but papers will be delivered in the language each scholar feels more confortable with. Abstracts of proposals and a short CV (max. 2 pages) in either English or Italian should be sent to: bo.workshop2012@gmail.com. Abstracts should be about 250 words in length, sent as an email attachment, listing name, organisation, contact address, telephone and email address, and should include the title of the proposed paper.   We aim to publish suitable submissions soon after the workshop. The deadline for the submission of proposals is 31 October 2011. Proposers will be informed whether their paper has been accepted in November 2011.    Enquiries about the workshop should be directed to: chiara.bcc@hotmail.co.uk  Valeria Babini (University of Bologna) Chiara Beccalossi (University of Queensland) Lucy Riall (Birkbeck University of London)      </inhalt>
