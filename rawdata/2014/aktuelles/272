<p>Summer school organised by the European Center of Linguistics (EZS): Historical uncertainties and linguistic constructions. Reports and narrations past from the perspectives of linguistics and literature studies</p>

<p>The European Center for Linguistics (EZS), a co-operation between the Ruprecht-Karls-University of Heidelberg and the Institute for German Language Mannheim (IDS), is advertising 35 places for participants at the Summer School „Historical uncertainties and linguistic constructions. Reports and narrations past from the perspectives of linguistics and literature studies”. The Summer School which is kindly supported by the Volkswagen Foundation is taking place at the German Department of the University of Heidelberg from the 28th July - 1st August 2014.</p>

<p>The summer school will focus on the linguistic treatment of historical realities in politically and socially unstable eras, such as the division of Europe after 1945 or during 1914, the year World War I broke out. The historical turning points are reflected symptomatically in the linguistic construction of historical events. This means they can be perceived, detected and analysed from the perspectives of literary studies and linguistics in factual and fictional texts. The hermeneutical pivot are texts, which reveal different perspectives and parallel histories depending on the author and the recipient. These texts are the foundation that connects linguistics and literature studies: (contemporary) history is constructed and received in oral and written sources. Different concepts and perceptions of social and political situations take shape in language and shape language themselves.</p>

<p>The combination of linguistics and literature studies, which we regard as a form of literature linguistics, allows us to find and analyse hidden interferences between modern narrative literature and reports in the media. The focus is on constructions of political, social and 
<br />Historical uncertainties and linguistic constructions.</p>

<p>In order to combine methods from linguistic and literature studies, one day of the summer school shall focus on the issues from a practical point of view after a more theoretical approach during the first days: Using the year 1914 as an example for the construction of history, we will examine and discuss different approaches by linguistics and literature studies. This promises to be particularly interesting since the year 2014 will probably see an increase in publications concerning World War I. These could be regarded as part of the construction of history, which means very topical texts could be analysed.</p>

<p>These issues shall be dealt with and discussed by linguists and literary scholars as well as historians and cultural scientists in this interdisciplinary summer school. The complete program as well as the abstracts of each presentation and workshop can be found on the homepage www.sommerschule2014.ezs-online.de</p>

<p>Requirements for participants and application</p>
