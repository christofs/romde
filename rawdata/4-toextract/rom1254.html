<inhalt>           <b> ECAS 2013 5th European Conference on African Studies African dynamics in a multipolar world </b>  <i> Panel: Words, arts and migration in Africa : narrative exploration </i>  This panel discusses the conditions of elaboration, circulation as well as contextualization of artistic forms (cinema, theatre, literature, media...) of local narratives of South-South-migration by the migrants themselves and their relatives. We invite proposals for a panel on narratives and migration in Africa for the fifth European Conference on African Studies (ECAS 5) which will take place in Lisbon, Portugal, June 26 to 28, 2013. The general theme of the conference is 'African Dynamics in a Multipolar World'.  Mobility is historically tied to West-African societies , however, the narratives about migratory processes within the « South » in Africa seem to be culturally specific. The discursive representations this mobility provokes are inscribed in specific cultural domains. This multi-disciplinary panel intends to discuss the conditions of elaboration and circulation as well as contextualization of local narratives of South-South-migration by the migrants themselves as well as their relatives. We are particularly interested in artistic elaborations of these myths, beliefs on departure, stay and return in South-South-migration in cinema, movies, theatre, literature, media (also : web), songs, dances...  Which role do these creative appropriations of the narratives on South-South-migration play in with regard to social and political processes connected to mobility ? In how far do these narratives allow us to question simple economic and deterministic explanations of migration processes within the south ?  *MIPRIMO is a collective and interdisciplinary project (2011-2013) about narratives and migration managed by Professor Cécile Canut (Paris René Descartes University  The call for papers is now open and will close on 16th January 2013. Please browse the list of accepted panels and make your proposal to an appropriate panel. On the panel page, beneath the long abstract you will find a link stating 'Propose a paper'. Click that to access the online form. All proposals must be made via the bespoke on-line facility that ECAS2013 is using to handle all proposals. Proposals should not be sent by email. Convenors wishing to present in their own panel should also use the online form to enter their proposal. Proposals should consist of a paper title, a (very) short abstract of less than 300 characters, and an abstract of 250 words. The proposal may also state the audio-visual requirements you have for your presentation.  Chair: Marina Lafay and Carola Mick Discussant: Cecile Canut, Professor Paris René Descartes      </inhalt>
