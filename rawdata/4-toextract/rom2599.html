Email: langsdopg@st-andrews.ac.uk  Two New PhD Studentships for fees and maintenance The School of Modern Languages is pleased to announce that in addition to our existing studentships, two new School PhD awards are available for students who wish to begin their PhDs during the academic year 2009/10 and who have not yet applied to the University of St Andrews.  The School invites applications for two PhD studentships, available to UK/EU students who wish to undertake doctoral study in the School of Modern Languages (French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish and Latin American Studies, Cultural Identity Studies). To be considered for these studentships, students must register between 1st September and 15th October 2009.  Each studentship is worth £7,000 per year, for a period of three years of full-time doctoral study, or to be adapted accordingly for part time study. This amount will pay tuition fees (currently £3,400 per year for Home/EU students), with the remainder of the sum contributing to maintenance.
