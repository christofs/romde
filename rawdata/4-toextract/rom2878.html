<inhalt>           The Seminar on the Acquisition of Latin American Library Materials (SALALM) is pleased to announce its 54th annual meeting to be held July 3–8, 2009 in Berlin, Germany. The theme for 2009 is Migrations and Connections: Latin America and Europe in the Modern World. The conference is sponsored by the Ibero-American Institute (IAI), which is home to the largest library in Europe specializing in Latin America, the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal.  The conference program will focus on several major themes surrounding the varied relationships forged between Latin America and Europe in the modern, post-independence era. One key set of topics will be the movement of peoples in both directions: European immigration to Latin America, the experience of politically-motivated exile between both world regions, and the contemporary flows of Latin Americans to European cities and emergence of new migrant communities. Equally engaging is the transmission of ideas, knowledge, and cultural practices. We will explore key intersections between European and Latin American writers, artists, philosophers, scientists, and intellectuals. How and why did such connections emerge and with what impact on the cultural, artistic and literary traditions in Latin America and Europe? Our program will also feature papers and presentations that analyze contemporary relations between Latin America and Europe in the context of globalization. How can new patterns of relations be understood against a backdrop of centuries of European-Latin American contact?  In addition to the scholarly presentations and panels, an important purpose of the conference will be to highlight major libraries, archives and digital collections that document and enable research on Latin American Studies within European libraries and academic institutions. We will feature presentations on both traditional collections and collecting strategies along with digital projects that open access to distinctive and unique resources. How have existing collaborations enhanced access to important scholarly collections? What connections between scholars, librarians, and archivists in the Americas and Europe can promote access to valuable resources? SALALM actively encourages and welcomes the participation of librarians, archivists, scholars, and information professionals based in European institutions and organizations, along with those from the United States and Latin America. In this way, the SALALM 2009 meeting will promote greater awareness of professional activities on both sides of the Atlantic and we look forward to a productive exchange  Meetings for SALALM 54 will take place at the Maritim Hotel Berlin, situated near the Ibero-American Institute at the Potsdamer Platz in the heart of Berlin.     </inhalt>
