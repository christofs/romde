<inhalt>           The aim of the International Conference &quot,Translating Fictional Dialogue for Children&quot, is the study of problems arising from linguistic mediation in translation for children and young people. In contrast to the many other events that have been organised during the last years around the general topic of children's literature, the Conference will focus on one single aspect: the translation of fictional dialogue.  Fictional dialogue, as the link between the literary and the multimodal text, is the appropriate place for evoking orality, lending authenticity and credibility to the narrated plot and giving a voice to fictitious characters. In order to achieve this mimesis of the spoken language, also called &quot,feigned orality&quot,, the author of a fictional text selects specific features, considered typical of the language of communicative immediateness, which may also include stereotyped elements, depending on the language and the culture in question as well as on the current literary conventions in each period.  The Conference will focus mainly (but not only) on modern literature (prose, theatre, comics), as after the 1920s the language used in children's literature was renewed, in line with the realistic representation of everyday life and language in adult fiction. As a result, oral traits have in­creasingly found their way into fictional dialogue in the genre.  Fictional dialogue is the link between the literary and the multimodal text. Consequently, another aim of the Conference is to investigate the evocation of orality in the various types of audiovisual translation, primarily dubbing and subtitling. There is also an increasing interest in investigating the evocation and recreation of the language of communicative immediateness in the field of accessibility to audiovisual media services, represented by the subtitling type of captions for the deaf and hearing impaired. Finally, the Conference aims to promote studies concerning metalinguistic reflections on authors and translators of fictional texts as important manifestations of linguistic awareness.  The Conference is part of the activities undertaken in the research project La traducción del diálogo ficcional. Textos literarios y textos multimodales (&quot,The translation of fictional dialogue. Literary and multimodal texts&quot,), funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.  <h3>Conference Programme</h3> <b>Monday, December 12th, 2011</b>  10.00 – 10.15: Opening  10.15 – 11.00: Plenary lecture.
