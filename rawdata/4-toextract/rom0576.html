<inhalt>           Although network images depicting the development of species and languages can be traced back to the 18th century in both linguistics and biology, models of reticulation instead of the powerful tree representations have only recently gained growing interest in the sciences and humanities and are now widely used on a formalized basis. In biology, research in procaryot evolution suggests lateral gene transfer as a major feature in the development of bacteria. In the field of linguistics, mutual borrowings between languages, the wave-like distribution of lexical innovations and the diffusion of lexical and morphological features seem to be rather the rule than the exception. In the humanities, networks are employed as an alternative to established phylogenetic models to express the hybridization of cultural phenomena.   Our international conference to be held at Reisensburg intends to encourage further interdisciplinary exchange between scholars from the sciences and humanities and is organized as part of the research project Classification and Evolution in Biology, Linguistics and the History of Science funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Participants will explore in detail whether networks might provide a more appropriate model describing processes of evolutionary development than pedigree models.  Therefore, biologists, linguists, historians and philosophers of science will present new research results and engage in discussions.
