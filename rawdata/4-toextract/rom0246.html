<inhalt>           50 Birmingham Fellowships Education Studies, Historical and Philosophical Studies, Languages, Literature and Culture, Psychology University of Birmingham  At Birmingham we are committed to investing in and developing new academic talent.  Birmingham Fellowships will be available across the University's disciplines, with priority areas identified on our website.  Fellows will receive start-up, development and mentoring support and their work will be research focused with opportunities to teach, including PhD supervision. At the end of five years, Fellows who have excelled will be offered a permanent academic post.  Candidates must demonstrate outstanding academic achievement in their discipline and an accelerating record of publications of international or world-leading quality. They should be on a trajectory to become research leaders. Candidates who will bring funded external fellowships are particularly welcome and will be fast tracked.  Salary will normally be £36,862 to £49,539 (Grade 8), although in exceptional cases appointments may be made at a higher grade. We welcome applications from Clinical Scientists.  Applications will be considered on a rolling basis, but the first deadline for applicants without external funding is 1 September 2011.
