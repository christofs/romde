<inhalt>           The Interdisciplinary Centre for Social and Language Documentation (CIDLeS) cordially invites scholars working on endangered languages in Europe and on Language Documentation to join us at the International Conference on Endangered Languages in Europe. The 2-day International Conference aims to improve the discussion about linguistic diversity in Europe and to provide an interdisciplinary forum in which scholars from Language Documentation, Language Technology and others working on European endangered languages can exchange ideas and techniques on language documentation, archiving, and revitalization and to reflect on language policy issues. The second day of the Conference will have two special panels: one focussing on the endangered languages in the Iberian Peninsula and another one, a round table, dedicated to the theme &quot,new speakers of minority/endangered languages&quot,.      The Conference is organized by the Interdisciplinary Centre for Social and Language Documentation in Minde, Portugal.   The Conference will include a broad socio-cultural program related to the theme &quot,Endangered Languages in Europe&quot, with the aim of promoting intercultural exchange and reinforcing the relationship between linguists and language communities. On the 19th of October 2013 there will be a &quot,Language Fair&quot, will take place, in which several members of endangered language communities in Europe will present their languages and cultures through book displays and cultural events (music, theatre, movies, exhibitions, etc.). On the evenings of 18th and 19th October there will be an “Endangered Languages Music Festival”.
