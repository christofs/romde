<inhalt>           Der einwöchige Graduiertenkurs richtet sich primär an Doktorierende der Universität Bern, der Schweiz und dem Ausland. Dieses international sehr erfolgreiche Instrument der Nachwuchsförderung verfolgt das Ziel der Vernetzung in Hinblick auf längerfristige Kooperationen und unterstützt den Erkenntnisgewinn durch die intensive Auseinandersetzung mit den theoretischen und methodischen Grundlagen der Geistes-, Kultur- und Sozialwissenschaften. Inhaltlich sollen unter dem Titel &quot,TransFormations&quot, lokale und globale Veränderungsprozesse in ihren unterschiedlichsten Ausformungen an den thematischen Schnittstellen von Wissen, Geschichte, Kultur und Gesellschaft analysiert und mitgestaltet werden.    Achtung: Bewerbungsfrist 2012: 27. November 2011!  <h3>WinterSchool 2012: TransFormations</h3> From 2012 to 2015, with the IASH as the leading institute, the Philosophical-Historical Faculty of the University of Bern organizes four international Winter Schools of one week each. Under the thematic umbrella &quot,TransFormations&quot,, the Winter School concentrates on the analysis and shaping of local and global processes of change in its various forms and formations at the intersections of knowledge, history, culture and society.  TransForming Knowledge and Epistemic Cultures In post-industrial societies, due to the impact of globalisation and technological development, we are witnessing a growth and diversification of the sites of knowledge production and the ways in which a variety of actors articulate and circulate knowledge. As a result, the privileged position of ‘scientific’ knowledge is contested, making knowledge the symbolic and material capital not only of academic ‘experts’. By the same token, the authorization of ‘knowledge’ becomes a matter of debate and changing power structures. The Winter School analyses and discusses these changes from a historical, sociological, cultural and philosophical perspective. It reflects in particular on the challenges thereof for the humanities and the social sciences regarding their role in the knowledge society of (post)modernity and their contribution to larger processes of transformation.  Invited guests and the focus of their lecture in the morning sessions of the Winter School - Prof. Dr. Christiane Schildknecht (Philosophy, University of Lucerne): An explication of the concept of knowledge, including its limits and an analysis of different forms of knowledge. - PD Dr. Roland Wenzlhuemer (History, University of Heidelberg): The changing relation between information and knowledge: new communication technologies and contemporary societies’ perception of them – the example of telegraphy. - Prof. Dr. Michael Hagner (Science Studies, ETH Zurich): Generation and transfer of knowledge in the digital age: the fate of the printed book and changing notions of intellectual property, reading, writing and interpretation. - PD Dr. Stefan Willer (Literary Studies, ZfL Berlin): Figurations of future knowledge: a rhetorical and epistemological investigation of knowledge-tocome in connection to current prognostic notions like 'sustainability', 'security', 'scenario', 'contingency'.  Formats The Winter School will be discussion-oriented. Daily morning sessions will include lectures given by four international scholars addressing the topic from various angles, followed by responses and plenary discussions. These sessions will prepare the ground for more general discussions in the master classes held in the afternoon. The workshop-like master classes focus on key concepts and core texts the participants will suggest in advance. There will be no presentations of individual work, posters of participants’ research will foster informal exchange throughout the week instead. Moreover, parallel workshops on the final day encourage the development of collaborations on shared research questions between at least two participants. Social media (website, wiki, blog) will be made available to connect participants before the conference and to document the discussions.
