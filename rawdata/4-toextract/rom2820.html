<inhalt>           You are interested in Salman Rushdie and Tolstoy or Goethe, in new concepts of world literature and new methods in literary study? You watch &quot,Games of Thrones&quot, and read &quot,Harry Potter&quot,, you write and read fan fiction? Maybe the spring school on world literature is your place to be in 2014.  <b>World Literature : Reading and Writing in the Age of Globalisation. International Spring School for Students </b>  Venue: Historic Observatory of Carl Friedrich Gauss, University of Göttingen, Germany   Two weeks of intensive reading across borders, learning new methods and interaction with some of the best international literary scholars and writers!  Main speakers include: David Damrosch (Harvard), Frank Hakemulder (Utrecht), Eric Hayot (Penn State), Bettina Kümmerling-Meibauer (Tübingen), Massimo Salgaro (Verona), Elena Semino (Lancaster) et al.  We all get lost in books, videos, games and all sorts of stories - without caring about the linguistic or national origin of a story. &quot,Harry Potter&quot, circulates around the globe seemingly without any problem of adaptation in China or India. Japanese variations of the 19th century novel &quot,Heidi&quot, are a worldwide success and only a few people know about the model behind Goethe's &quot,Wilhelm Meister&quot,. Series like &quot,The Wire&quot, amalgamate longstanding traditions of detective and social novels and are watched in so many different countries and environments that it is hard to say which national paradigm the production belongs to. New types of writing, like fan fiction, seem to have no border at all. Children's books are always read in more than one language and country. Books for young people like Eoin Colfers &quot,Artemis Fowl&quot, and fantasy serial like George R.R. Martins &quot,Game of Thrones&quot, are international events. And Salman Rushdie is probably the most well-known name, which symbolizes a literature crossing the borders of language and genre, media and age, social groups, nations and aesthetic traditions faster than ever before.   It seems that the older vision of world literature is becoming true in the age of globalization.  This spring school explores the literature in a globalizing world. It invites talented students from all over Europe to discover the expanding universe of twenty-first century literature, where the classic canon of (Western) masterpieces is only one part of a much broader literature read and re-written all over the world. This spring school will be an encounter with highly-regarded literary scholars, critics and writers, and will introduce cutting edge research methods and theories for the inquiry of the world's literary cultures that sweep the globe. In this two-week interactive programme, participants will read across borders, actively discuss their experiences in small groups and attend talks, lectures and teaching sessions.  APPLY NOW!  Applicants - Bachelor, Master, PhD - should have working knowledge of methods in literary and media studies, should well and widely read in more than one literature and one medium. Experience of writing is also welcome.  We are committed to admitting talented students from diverse backgrounds. Accepted applicants will receive a scholarship to cover most of tuition, travel, lodging and food. We are looking forward to receiving your application!  The online application period for this summer school will close on 30 September 2013.
