<inhalt>           The field of language documentation has matured over the last 15 years. With several funding initiatives running out, community-driven language documentation ensures sustainable documentation.    This summer school is designed to encourage community-driven interdisciplinary language documentation. It will bring together speakers of endangered languages, local language workers, students and researchers of linguistics and related fields. The summer school is intended to be a space for engagement and exchange between community members, language workers and students and provide an environment for learning about each other’s interests and requirements.    The curriculum is developed to be in accordance with the needs and interests of the speech communities. It aims at empowering the speech communities to participate in the definition and implementation of research projects and sensitise students of linguistic for the needs of the communities. Thus, the major goal of this summer school is to introduce the participants into the theory and methods of language documentation. The goal is to acquire the knowledge and competence to conduct one's own documentation projects with regard to endangered language.  This summer school is part of a larger event. The week before CDLD 2014 there will be another one-week summer school on Coding for Language Communities.    CDLD 2014 will focus on the theory, methods and techniques of language documentation and revitalization and on their interdisciplinary character. Each day will consist of two learning sessions in the morning: one general lecture and a course lecture (seminar-like unit) that will introduce the participants to the course tutorials (practice unit) which will take place in the afternoon.
