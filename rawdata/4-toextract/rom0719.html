<inhalt>           BEYOND ITALY AND NEW SPAIN Itineraries for an Iberian Art History (1440-1640)  Organizers: Michael Cole and Alessandra Russo  April, 27th-29th, 2012 Columbia University  Deadline: Sep 25, 2011  The Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America / Department of  Latin American and Iberian Cultures  Co-sponsored by the Department of Art History and Archeology  Call for papers  This conference aims to open new dialogues on Iberian art and  architecture from the decade that saw the Aragonese conquest of  Southern Italy (1443) and the establishment of the first Portuguese  trading station on the African island of Arguim (1449) to that of the  separation of the Portuguese and the Spanish crowns (1640).  Art historical scholarship on Spanish Naples, Hapsburg Netherlands, New  Spain or Peru, like that on Portugal and on the former Portuguese  possessions, has largely remained local. We therefore invite proposals  for papers that would discuss artistic dynamics in or between at least  two zones of the Iberian atlas (Portugal, Brazil, Flanders, Spain, Goa,  Macao, Milan, Naples, Peru, the Philippines, Sicily, Sierra Leone,  etc.). Themes may include the movement, reinstallation, and  reinterpretation of images and objects, the materials of art making and  their changing (or unchanging) meaning, printed and other reproductions  and their relationship to new originals, the reinterpretation of  architectural models in response to differing landscapes, labor  conditions, technologies, and functional requirements, the travel of  artists, patrons, and viewers, competing religious, political,  intellectual, or patronage networks (Jesuits vs Franciscans, traders vs  missionaries, Portuguese vs Dutch, etc.), the literature of art and its  forms across space. Especially welcome are proposals that address both  specific works and methodological questions.  Please send proposals by September, 25th, 2011 to: mc3371@columbia.edu and ar2701@columbia.edu  Accepted papers will receive funding for travel to NYC.      </inhalt>
