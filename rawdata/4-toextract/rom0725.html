<inhalt>           Calling all postgraduate researchers in French!   The Cambridge French Graduate Research Seminar series (FGRS) are currently looking for speakers for the coming year. The seminar series offers postgraduate students in French the chance to present and discuss their work in a relaxed and supportive environment. It is also the only seminar series in the Cambridge French department which allows graduate students from all periods to enter into dialogue with each other. There are normally two speakers per session and we ask for each speaker to present a twenty-minute paper which is then followed by questions and wider discussion - and a trip to the pub! We're keen to hear from postgraduates at any stage of their research, and we would also welcome students of other languages, and from other disciplines (arts, humanities, sciences) whose work relates to the broad field of French Studies.  We are currently looking for speakers for Tuesday 18th October, and for the following two terms. Sessions will be held on Tuesdays, at 5.15 for a 5.30 start. Reasonable travel expenses (up to £50) can be paid for speakers from outside Cambridge.  If you would like to present a paper please get in touch, letting us know what you would like to speak on and which of the above dates are possible for you. Our email address is fgrscam@gmail.com  Our Facebook page will have details of the upcoming events:  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/French-Graduate-Research-Seminar-FGRS/214339758601977" target="_blank" >www.facebook.com/pages/French-Graduate-Research-Seminar-FGRS/214339758601977</a>       </inhalt>
