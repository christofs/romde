<inhalt>           10 Ph.D. Scholarships in Linguistics “Frequency effects in language”  The University of Freiburg, one of Germany’s nine Universities of   Excellence, invites applications for 10 fully-funded Ph.D.   scholarships in linguistics, beginning no earlier than October 1,   2009, and no later than March 1, 2010. Successful applicants will be   members of the Research Training Group on “Frequency effects in   language” (Graduiertenkolleg GRK 1624/1) funded by the German Research   Foundation (DFG).  Frequency is assumed to be a possible determinant in usage-based   models of language change, language acquisition and language   processing. In the Ph.D. projects this determinant will be   investigated with a view both to its explanatory potential and its   limitations. The envisaged research integrates descriptive-linguistic   and cognitivist-psycholinguistic approaches and is empirically based   on corpora for standard and non-standard varieties of European   languages.  We offer a high-profile research environment, an interdisciplinary   teaching programme, a full grant of 13,200 € per annum for a period of   up to 3 years, and additional grants covering travel and research   expenses.  For more information on the Research Training Group, envisaged Ph.D.   projects, and application details, please visit our website: <a href="http://www.hpsl.uni-freiburg.de/grk-frequenz" target="_blank" >www.hpsl.uni-freiburg.de/grk-frequenz</a>   Deadline for application: June 22, 2009      </inhalt>
