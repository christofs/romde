<inhalt>           Professionalising Multilingualism in Higher Education: Developing Plurilingual Individuals and Multilingual Institutions  Following previous conferences dealing with multilingual Universities, the 2010 conference will address the issue of professionalisation in relation to the development of institutional multilingualism and individual plurilingualism. In order to deal with this issue, firstly, the figure of a non-native speaker or learner, trying to bridge the gap to the native speaker, is replaced by the more complete figure of the learner as a social actor. Secondly, complex interactions are considered in space and time as they are interconnected along four independent dimensions.  Please see: <a href="http://www.multilingualuniversities.net/" target="_blank" >www.multilingualuniversities.net</a>   Call for Papers  Five thematic strands have been identified according to the conceptual framework of the conference.  Thematic Strands  1. Becoming a plurilingual professional in a multilingual world. Research has emphasized the role of higher education in the development of plurilingualism and multicultural areas. From this point of view, the training issue and the question of vocational teacher training is of core interest: which characteristics have to be developed in professionals in teaching (not only in teaching languages)? Which challenges and contexts have to be managed by the plurilingual professionals?  2. Multilingualism in higher education and research: an economic perspective Multilingual universities represent the economic dimensions of multilingualism today. On the one hand side, university administrations have to handle costs and validations regarding documents and the set-up of administration in different languages. On the other hand, they are key players in the creation of added value with regard to the future economic success of candidates in a multilingual world and the enhancement the potentials of a region which hosts a multilingual university.  3. Plurilingual biographies and professional identities Everyday life at university engages biographical, linguistic and professional backgrounds as regards acting in formal and informal multilingual communication at university in scientific, technical or administrative domains. Moreover, multilingual biographies and professional practices serve as training tools for multilingualism in professional contexts outside the academic framework.  4. Multilingual higher education: implementing multilingual study programmes and assessment Multilingual higher education settings raise the question of the implementation of standards and normalization efforts for multilingualism and/or multilingual practices. Moreover, experiences and observations of multilingual study programmes and their successful implementation demonstrate new models of assessment and evaluation, which cannot (only) be based on monolingual standards.  5. Language policies for multilingual universities Beyond linguistic imperialism and historical implications, languages compete in relation to their roles in vocational domains, geographic areas, individual practices, institutional rules and political regulations. Firstly multilingual universities, here the university of Luxembourg, have issues of territorial, societal and educational multilingualisms. Secondly, in general, the transferability of the model of the multilingual university needs to be investigated and further developed.
