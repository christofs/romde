<inhalt>           Oxford Graduate Symposium in Spanish Golden Age Studies 'Grave Matters and Glorious Ends: Death in the Spanish Golden Age'  For the majority of people in the Spanish Golden Age, death was a part of everyday life. Its pervading presence is reflected in the ubiquity of the theme in the art, music and literature of the period. Far from being a social taboo, the contemplation of death, as a social, political or religious reality was positively encouraged, with the intention of ensuring that one died “well”, and lived in preparation for this. This idea of the “good death”, so alien to us today, will be the subject of the third Oxford Graduate Symposium in Spanish Golden Age Studies.   Through papers on a variety of topics, we hope to address the following questions: What did it mean to “die well” in the Hispanic world of the Early Modern period? How is this conceived of differently in the religious, philosophical and political spheres? What are the various ways in which one could achieve a “good death”? How was this intended to affect how one lived one’s life in the here and now? What examples are given in literature and art of the “good death”? Are they purely exemplary? Were they effective? Are there, conversely, examples of “bad deaths”? Are there cases which can encompass both ideas? How is death presented in order to make it exemplary?   Topics may include, but are not confined to, the following:  •Martyrdom and Saint’s death •the Passion of Christ •honour killings and wife-murder plays •vanitas and memento mori •regicide •the glorious death •Heaven and hell •infant mortality •representations of death and the dead •customs of mourning •political and philosophical treatments of death  We welcome proposals of up to 250 words from graduate students and early career researchers, for papers of no more than 20 minutes, in English or Spanish, to alice.brooke@merton.ox.ac.uk no later than 15th November 2011.       </inhalt>
