<inhalt>           The Hispanic Baroque Project, Liverpool 12.05.2010-14.05.2010, The Foresight Centre, University of Liverpool, 1 Brownlow Street, Liverpool, L69 3GL, United Kingdom  RELIGION IN THE HISPANIC BAROQUE:  THE FIRST ATLANTIC CULTURE AND ITS LEGACY  The Foresight Centre, Liverpool, 12-14 May 2010  This interdisciplinary conference will look at the role of religion in the Hispanic Baroque. We propose to explore the Baroque not merely as a specific and historical set of literary, artistic and architectural styles. Rather we seek to study it as a complex cultural system that emerged from early modern transatlantic interaction and exchange of knowledge and imagination, and that continues to shape the political, social and cultural reality of the Atlantic world and beyond to this day. We invite the submission of proposals from every disciplinary background interested in one or both of our two main strands of investigation.   Our first strand focuses on religion as a media through which political and social conflict in the early modern and modern Hispanic world are exacerbated as well as negotiated.  We want to examine the ways in which religion shaped individual and collective identities and was in turn shaped by conflict and compromise arising from colonization, resistance and mestizaje. This strand seeks to deepen our understanding of the mutually transformative relationship between religion and society in the Hispanic world from the fifteenth century to the present by looking at religion as the means, medium or obstacle to the creation of social, political and cultural stability. We thus hope to be able to pinpoint the features of interaction between religion and society that are specific to the Hispanic Baroque.  In our second strand of investigation we want to compare complex transatlantic technologies and patterns of interaction characteristic for the Hispanic Baroque with those of other cultural spheres. For instance, in how far can we describe Baroque religion as a cultural system and system of communication transcending the boundaries of confession, nation, language and mode of artistic expression? Can we regard Baroque religion and also the Baroque generally as cross-cultural phenomena producing and sustaining patterns of cultural interaction that are dynamic and stable over long periods of time? What can the study of Baroque cultures and their modes of conflict and resolution tell us about the need and the ways to balance complex contemporary societies?   Possible Themes for Panels include: - The Universal Baroque? - Baroque Media from the Sixteenth to the 21 Century - Baroque Science - Baroque Arts  - Baroque Spaces - Religion, Conflict and Identity in Baroque Societies - Religion, Culture, and Commerce - Complex Legacy: Enduring Patterns of Baroque Religion  PROPOSALS for papers should include a title, an abstract of about 250 words, and your full contact details (including an e-mail if possible). We welcome the proposal of panels and we warmly encourage postgraduate submissions. Please send your proposals by  30th September 2009 (post or email) to:  Dr Harald E.
