A combination of disciplines is possible and will be welcomed, as is a combination of one of the mentioned disciplines and New Media Studies.  The department of Arts, Culture, and Media offers four art disciplines: Film, Theatre, Literary and Music Studies. In close cooperation with the department of Art History and Architecture a fifth discipline - Visual Arts - is offered. For their bachelor exam, students specialize in one of these art disciplines, which they combine with a major in one of the contextual specializations: Analysis and Criticism, Arts Policy and Management, or Arts Education.  Research in the department is focused on the functioning of the arts in society, approached from various theoretical and methodological perspectives. This research is carried out in the context of the interdisciplinary Institute for Cultural Research Groningen.  What we expect: - a strong and inspiring contribution to our teaching in one or more of the fields mentioned - a dynamic and stimulating participation in the research of the Institute for Cultural Research Groningen (time for research constitutes 40% of the total time available): the candidate should have his or her own research specialism and research programme, he/she should be able to initiate and coordinate research cooperation within the department and within the faculty, supervise PhD theses, and secure external funding for research projects - the performance of administrative and organizational duties.  Requirements The candidate must have a doctorate in the field of Arts and Society, or a closely related field. He/she has at least two years of (international) post doctoral experience and a track record of outstanding, internationally recognized research, with publications in leading journals cited by prominent researchers. He/she is able to acquire external research funds, including third party funding from cultural organizations, and supervise PhD theses. He/she has a solid network in the field of the arts. He/she has excellent organizational and teaching skills, is fluent in English and has a good knowledge of Dutch, or is willing to learn this language within two years.  Conditions of employment The University of Groningen offers a salary dependent on qualifications and work experience between € 3,872 and € 5,390 (CAO-NU, scale 12-13) gross per month for a full-time position.  The appointment will initially be made for 2 to 5 years as assistant professor. Before the end of the temporary appointment, there will be an assessment of performance based on established criteria including research and teaching qualifications. A positive appraisal will lead to promotion to the rank of associate professor, followed after three more years by a promotion to the rank of junior professor, after a positive evaluation. After 1-4 years a new assessment for promotion to full professor will take place, according to the standard criteria of the faculty. The different phases of the tenure track may be reduced depending on academic results of the fellow before and during the fellowship.
