<inhalt>           Postdoctoral Research Assistant ‘The Old French William of Tyre and its Continuations.’  Cardiff School of History and Archaeology  Cardiff University is seeking to appoint a postdoctoral research assistant to play a major role within the forthcoming three-year AHRC-funded project on the Old French William of Tyre and its Continuations, led by Professor Peter Edbury.  The research assistant will co-edit the text of the continuations together with the associated work known as the Chronique d’Ernoul et de Bernard le Trésorier and be responsible for examining in situ the manuscripts. There may also be an opportunity to offer a limited amount of teaching within the School of History and Archaeology depending on his/her specialisms.  Applicants must have a PhD (or anticipate completion comfortably before the start date) in a branch of medieval studies or in a field pertinent to the project (e.g. manuscript study). A very good command of Medieval French is essential. Experience of working with western European manuscripts is highly desirable as is an interest in the history of the Crusades and the Latin East.  This post represents an excellent opportunity for someone early in his/her academic career to be an important part of a high-profile project and to gain valuable experience while developing a substantial publication profile. The successful applicant will also benefit from the supportive research environment of the Cardiff Centre for the Study of the Crusades and the Cardiff Centre for the Study of Medieval Society and Culture.  Duration of appointment 1 September 2009- 31 August 2012  Starting Salary £29704/£31513  Enquiries Professor Peter Edbury: edbury@cf.ac.uk  Reference 2009/0159  Application process Please see <a href="http://www.cf.ac.uk/jobs/academic/20090159-" target="_blank" >www.cf.ac.uk/jobs/academic/20090159-</a> 090409.html  Application deadline 9 April 2009       </inhalt>
