<inhalt>           The University of Freiburg, one of Germany’s nine Universities of Excellence, invites applications for   <b>8 fully-funded Ph.D. scholarships on the topic of frequency effects in language</b>,  beginning no earlier than October 1, 2012, and no later than March 1, 2013. Successful applicants will be members of the Special Research Training Group on “Frequency effects in language” (Graduiertenkolleg GRK 1624/1) funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).  Frequency is assumed to be a possible determinant in usage-based models of language change, language acquisition and language processing. In the Ph.D. projects this determinant is being investigated with a view both to its explanatory potential and to its limitations. The envisaged research combines quantitative approaches to language with cognitivist-psycholinguistic approaches and is empirically based on experimental and corpus data for standard and non-standard varieties of different languages. This research agenda is without parallel and opens up a new, constructively critical approach to usage-based modelling in linguistics that has great innovative potential.  The University of Freiburg has created a unique infrastructure and research environment in linguistics and cognitive science, especially for graduates at Ph.D. and postdoctoral level. There are Masters programmes in linguistics and cognitive science, the powerful linguistics units at the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS) and the Hermann-Paul-Graduate School of Language Sciences (HPSL), regular events with the leading linguists of the world, and strong connections to the University of Basel.  WE OFFER: - a full grant of 13,200 € per annum for a period of up to 3 years (subject to intermediate evaluations) - 1,000 € travel grant per annum funds for inviting guest scholars and organizing workshops - an interdisciplinary teaching programme that enables you to carry out state-of-the art research projects - an efficient supervision and mentoring programme - a high-profile research environment bridging the gap between linguistics and the cognitive-psycholinguistic sciences - a wide range of workshops, guest lectures and one-on-one tutorials with and by leading linguists of the world hosted as external Fellows at the FRIAS - a vibrant community of Ph.D. students and post-docs in the language sciences - one of the leading European universities (both in teaching and research, member of the League of European Research Universities) - a campus in the city centre with a highly international atmosphere - one of the most attractive university towns in Germany (total population: about 220,000), capital of the Black Forest, in one of the most scenic areas of Germany, bordering immediately on France and Switzerland  WE EXPECT: - an excellent first degree in linguistics, cognitive science, or a related field - a high degree of motivation and interest in shaping and working on a Ph.D. project on frequency effects in language. A list of possible projects is provided. Additional suitable and/or related proposals are welcome. - communication skills in both English and German, and very good language skills (written and spoken) in at least one of these two languages (minimum: level C1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for languages)  Come and join one of the currently most vibrant linguistics scenes in Europe!     </inhalt>
