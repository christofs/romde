<inhalt>           Applications are invited for the position of one early stage – or doctoral – researcher (36 months, full time) in Diaspora Studies to work on a project situated within the area of literary and film studies at the Westfaelische Wilhelms-Universitaet Muenster, Germany.  Marie Curie Initial Training Network “Diasporic Constructions of Home and Belonging” (CoHaB) All over the world, stable concepts of home and belonging have, for a variety of reasons, become the exception rather than the rule, which has led to dramatic cultural, social and political changes and challenges. The study of diaspora and migration has evolved into a burgeoning field which sets an urgent research agenda for our time. The EU-funded trans-national network CoHaB comprises acknowledged Diaspora Studies experts from the universities of Muenster, Oxford, SOAS, Stockholm, Mumbai and Northampton, as well as several non-academic partners. Committed to excellence in facilitating research for scholars in the early phases of their careers, the network is united in the conviction that interdisciplinary and transnational training as well as international and inter-sectoral co-operation are key to any productive study of diaspora. Applicants must document research interests and expertise in relevant fields, especially literary studies, film studies and diaspora studies and be willing to network across academic and non-academic institutions as part of their research.  Research training within a variety of disciplinary environments, both academic and extramural, is central to the CoHaB network. Secondments to associated non-academic partners will help Marie Curie Research Fellows in Diaspora Studies to gain insight into specific diaspora-related, extramural fields of work, and also integrate the findings rising from their work experience with their academic work. Close co-operation within the network will allow researchers from various disciplinary backgrounds to join forces and develop their projects on a shared platform.  Applicants will be expected to engage in a continuing dialogue about the methodology, theory, and terminology of diaspora studies as a transdiscipline. In the context of the specific project, this entails literary/cultural studies, film studies, and sociology.  Project: Diasporas and the Literature of Globalisation This project will combine the analysis of novels, plays and poems that deal with forms of contemporary globalisation and diasporic subjects with the critical reading of theorists of globalisation and diaspora and the discussion of contemporary films. In particular, it will focus on aspects on a local level that connect diasporic individuals around the globe. Which strategies ? aesthetic, narrative, theoretical ? do writers, artists and other diasporic agents use to refer to the dynamic relationship between global identity and rooted subjectivity? We invite applications suggesting specific corpuses for analysis.  Benefits The researcher will be employed by the WWU Muenster on a full-time basis as a PhD student, with a gross salary of 37,392 € p.a. and full social security benefits. The position also includes a monthly mobility allowance as well as ample funds to participate in training activities of the CoHaB network and in international conferences.  Requirements Applicants must: - have a first class Master’s degree (or equivalent) in one of the following areas: literary studies or film studies - have less than four years of research experience and must not yet have been awarded a doctoral degree - not have resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc.) in Germany for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately prior to their recruitment - have previous experience (academic and/or extra-mural) in the field of diaspora studies, especially from a literary or film studies perspective - have an excellent command of English (spoken and written) - satisfy the eligibility criteria for fellowships in Marie Curie Initial Training Networks  Applications must include: - a curriculum vitae (including information on nationality and place of residence for the past three years), - academic record (including transcripts), - letter of motivation, - two written references, - a short proposal (2,000 words) for a research project  Submit applications electronically, in a single PDF file, to: Prof. Dr. Klaus Stierstorfer at stierstorfer@wwu.de  Formal evaluation of candidates will begin on February 29, 2012, and continue until the position is filled. The successful candidate is expected to join CoHaB by April 2012. CoHaB is committed to equal opportunities and encourages applications from all sections of the international community worldwide.
