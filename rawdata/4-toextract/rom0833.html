<inhalt>           On 9-10 May 2013 the University of Warwick will host the first of three annual research colloquia on the theme of 'Renaissance Conflict and Rivalries: Cultural Polemics in Europe, c. 1300-c. 1650'. The colloquia spring from a Leverhulme International Network that seeks to explore the relationship between the cultural renewal that many contemporaries saw taking place in art, literature, scholarship, and science and the simultaneous prevalence of opposition, confrontation, and rivalry, well captured by the German term Streitkultur.  For further details on the Network and its aims, see <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/ren/projects/conflictandrivalries/" target="_blank" >www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/ren/projects/conflictandrivalries/</a>  The first colloquium will be devoted to the topic of 'Forms'. Questions to be explored will include: to what extent were conflict and rivalries in the Renaissance expressed through differing media (e.g., verbal/visual), languages (e.g., Latin/vernacular), and genres (invectives, pasquinades, rival translations of the classics, works of scholarship, sculpture/painting, religious/secular art or literature)? What processes determined these differing forms and whether or not it was acceptable to express notions of conflict and rivalries through them?  We wish to alert colleagues that several bursaries for travel and/or accommodation are available, particularly for postgraduates and early career researchers. Details, along with the provisional programme, are  available at <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/ren/projects/conflictandrivalries/colloquium1/" target="_blank" >www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/ren/projects/conflictandrivalries/colloquium1/</a>. The deadline for applying will be Tuesday, 16 April. We would be grateful if you could circulate this information to colleagues/students who may be interested.   Feel free to contact me (D.A.Lines@warwick.ac.uk) concerning scholarly aspects of the colloquium and the project more generally. Enquiries about logistics and bursaries should be directed to Ms Jayne Brown (renaissance@warwick.ac.uk), secretary of Warwick's Centre for the Study of the Renaissance.  Up to seven bursaries, covering accommodation and/or travel within the UK and Europe, are available. In the first instance these are meant for postgraduate students and early-career researchers (up to 5 years beyond the PhD) who wish to attend. Consideration will also be given to applicants who fall outside of these categories. There is no form for applying. Applicants should send a CV and a statement of 500-750 words outlining why they wish to participate to Ms Jayne Brown (renaissance@warwick.ac.uk) by 5:00 on Tuesday, 16 April. They should also ensure that a letter of support from their supervisor/mentor arrives by the same date (this can be as an email attachment, directly from the referee). We hope to notify applicants by the end of that week.  People participating at their own expense, and/or attending the colloquium for only daytime events, should contact Jayne Brown (renaissance@warwick.ac.uk) about the costs involved.  <i>Confirmed speakers will include: </i>  Concetta Bianca (Florence), 'Contentiosae disputationes' agli esordi della stampa  Donatella Coppini (Florence), La polemica Poliziano - Paolo Cortesi sull'imitazione Arnold Becker (Bonn): Positioning Strategies in Ulrich von Hutten's Polemical Dialogues Uwe Baumann (Bonn): The Humanistic and Religious Controversies and Rivalries of Sir Thomas More: A Typology of Literary Forms and Genres Irene Reginato / Eugenio Burgio (Ca' Foscari, Venice): Foundation Myths and Trade Conflicts: Ramusio, the Fourth Crusade and the Crisis of the Merchants of Venice in the Sixteenth Century Alessio Cotugno (Ca' Foscari, Venice): Le 'Annotationi' di Piccolomini e la 'Poetica' di Castelvetro a confronto: tecniche argomentative e vocabolario critico Irene Verziagi (Ca' Foscari, Venice): La Riforma e i Gesuiti come Stoici nei 'Ragguagli di Parnaso' di Traiano Boccalini Eugenio Refini (Warwick): The Courtier and the Philosopher's Stone: Rhetorical and Visual Conflicts in Fabio Glissenti's 'Discorsi morali' (1596)  Guido Giglioni (The Warburg Institute, London): Scaliger versus Cardano versus Scaliger: A Reassessment Jeroen De Keyser (Leuven): Lallus Lampooned: Francesco Filelfo’s Feud with Poggio Bracciolini Pascal Brioist (Tours): topic tba      </inhalt>
