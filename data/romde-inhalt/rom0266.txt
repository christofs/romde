7 Postdoctoral Fellowships "Rechtskulturen"
           The Berlin-based Forum Transregionale Studien invites scholars to apply for seven postdoctoral fellowships for the research project Rechtskulturen: Confrontations beyond Comparison.  Applicants should be at the postdoctoral level and should have obtained their doctorate within the last five years before their application to the program. We welcome candidates in particular from the disciplines of law, sociology, political science, philosophy, history, anthropology, theology, and area studies, representing a broad range of diverse approaches to the law, including gender studies, comparative research, law &amp, literature, critical approaches to international law, administrative sciences, transitional justice, the law of development cooperation, and classical problems of legal philosophy. We encourage and welcome applications from all regions of the world. Fellows are given the opportunity to pursue their individual research projects within a transdisciplinary and transregional context.  The postdoctoral fellow program Rechtskulturen ('legal cultures') is designed to explore the law in new and innovative ways. They intend to create a space of reflection and communication where fundamental and salient questions of the law and its context(s) can be re-negotiated from a variety of disciplinary and regional perspectives, and re-connected with jurisprudence and legal methodology.
