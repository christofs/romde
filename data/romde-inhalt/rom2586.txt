PhD fellowship, Italian Studies
           The Italian Department at the University of Warwick is offering   one Doctoral Fellowship  to an outstanding applicant for 2013–16. The fellowship covers all academic/tuition fees, whether for an EU or overseas student. In addition, the successful applicant will receive a maintenance grant of around £13,600 per year for three years. The doctoral fellow will be expected to contribute to Departmental teaching and other activities up to a maximum of 6 hours per week during term time as part of the conditions of the award.  Warwick’s Italian Department is an unusually collegial unit with a vibrant research culture. In the most recent Research Assessment Exercise (2008) it was ranked third nationally (second, on more specific measures). It has an enviable record of attracting research funding and has a distinctly interdisciplinary approach, linking literature very strongly with historical contexts, philosophy, theory, visual culture, migration and travel writing, and cultural and intellectual history. Its seven members of academic staff are able to supervise in most areas of Italian Studies, from Dante and the Renaissance to contemporary literature and culture. The library’s holdings are strong and can easily be supplemented by the libraries of Oxford and London, which are reachable within an hour by train.  Applicants should possess, or be about to receive, an MA degree or equivalent. The Doctoral Fellowship will be assigned on the basis of outstanding academic performance, the quality of the research proposal, and promise of scholarly excellence. Closing date for applications: Wednesday, 5 June 2013
