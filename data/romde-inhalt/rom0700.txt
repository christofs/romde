CfP: AHGBI Conference panel: Nicanor Parra
           2014 is the year of Nicanor Parra’s 100th birthday, an opportunity to honour the Chilean “antipoet” and his work with a dedicated panel at the AHGBI conference in Galway, Ireland (14–16 April 2014).   If you would like to offer a paper (20 minutes) on any aspect of Parra’s oeuvre and its reception, an abstract of 150–200 words should reach the panel convenor (details below) by 23 September 2013. I will then organise the proposals into a panel and forward it to the Conference Secretary for approval.  Please send enquiries and abstracts for papers to the panel convenor Dr Tilmann Altenberg at AltenbergTG@cardiff.ac.uk
