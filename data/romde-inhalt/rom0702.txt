CfP: Alberto Moravia: nuovi approcci per il terzo millennio
           INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE  Alberto Moravia: nuovi approcci per il terzo millennio  16.October 2010, University College Cork, Ireland  To mark the twentieth anniversary of the death of Alberto Moravia, Italian at University College Cork will host a one-day international conference devoted to Alberto Moravia’s work and its continued significance in the twenty-first century. Moravia’s critical engagement with the cultural and political situation of his time in Italy (1907-1990) is reflected not only in his journalism and essay writing, but especially in his hybrid narrative. Despite the existence of a significant body of criticism on Moravia, few studies have engaged with his narrative in light of the most recent developments in critical approaches (gender studies, psychoanalytic theory, cultural studies, new historicism, postmodernism etc.).  Proposals are invited on topics that offer fresh approaches to the study of Moravia’s literature with the aim of updating existing scholarship.  Suggested topics may include, but are not limited to:  - Moravia and gender, masculinities, femininities  - Moravia and sexualities/taboo/the body/desire  - Moravia and genre: the /romanzo-saggio/ /the /bildungsroman/ /the psychological novel/ the historical novel  - Moravia and psychoanalysis  - Moravia and postmodernism  Abstracts of a maximum of 300 words, along with a short biography stating background and research interests, should be sent to moraviaconference2010@gmail.com &lt,mailto:moraviaconference2010@gmail.com&gt,  Papers may be in either English or Italian, and should be no more than 20 minutes in length.  Abstracts must be received no later than 25 June 2010.
