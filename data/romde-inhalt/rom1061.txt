CfP: "Psychoanalysis and Italian Studies", panel, Society for Italian Studies Conference 2009
           I am currently organizing a panel on “Psychoanalysis and Italian Studies” for the SIS Conference 2009. I would like to invite papers on topics which include but are not limited to:  - The state of art of psychoanalytic criticism in Italy  - Psychoanalytically informed readings of works of Italian literature  - Psychoanalysis and Italian cinema  - The role of psychoanalysis in Italian culture and public discourse  - The relationship between psychoanalysis and academia in Italy  Papers focusing on, and making use of, post-Freudian and post-Kleinian approaches to literature, art and creativity (e.g. Bion, Meltzer, Winnicott, Lacan, Fornari etc.) will be particularly welcome.  I look forward to receiving abstracts from interested colleagues by 27 October.  Thank you and all best wishes,  Dr. Francesco Capello Visiting Lecturer of Italian University of Leeds francesco_capello@YAHOO.IT
