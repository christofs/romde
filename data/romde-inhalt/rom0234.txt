5 Ph.D. Scholarships in Linguistics "Frequency effects in language"
           The University of Freiburg, Germany, invites applications for 5 fully-funded Ph.D. scholarships on the topic of frequency effects in language, beginning no earlier than April 1, 2014, and no later than September 1, 2014. Successful applicants will be members of the Research Training Group on &quot,Frequency effects in language&quot, (Graduiertenkolleg GRK 1624/2), which after successful evaluation of its work by the German Research Foundation (DFG) is entering its second funding period.  Frequency is assumed to be an important determinant in usage-based models of language change, language acquisition and language pro­ces­sing. In the Ph.D. projects this determinant will be investigated with a view both to its explanatory potential and its limitations. The envisaged re­search combines quantitative-corpuslinguistic methods with experimental psycho- and neurolinguistics in the analysis of standard and non-standard data from a wide range of European languages.  We offer a high-profile research environment, an interdisciplinary tea­ching programme, a full grant of 13,200 € per annum for a period of up to 3 years, and additional grants covering travel and research expenses.
