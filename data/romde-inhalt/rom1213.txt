           Call for Papers Portuguese Literary &amp, Cultural Studies 21    University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth  Volume title:  Translating Diasporas Guest Editor: Christopher Larkosh  The twenty-first volume of Portuguese Literary &amp, Cultural Studies takes as its topic the theory and practice of translation in connection with the transformative cultural processes associated with ethnic diasporas, as well as with other forms of human and textual displacement both within and beyond the official borders of the Lusophone World. We invite scholars in Luso-Afro-Brazilian studies and theory, translation and interpretation studies, diaspora studies and other related disciplines in the humanities and social sciences to submit both scholarly articles and translated texts that speak to the diversity of translational activity in a diasporic world, especially between Portuguese and other languages, but not exclusively. The final result should be a multifaceted volume that contributes to a more comprehensive view of transcultural communication beyond present paradigms.   Topics for contributions may include:  • the role of translation in historical and literary encounters between Lusophone and other cultures, whether ‘Western,’ ‘non-Western’ or even those that complicate the continued insistence upon clearly defined ‘North-South’ or ‘East-West’ distinctions,   •the role of translation in the diffusion of intellectual movements to, from and around the Lusophone world (e.g., Renaissance, Baroque aesthetics, Romanticisms, magical realism, Luso- or pan-African literary movements, theory),  • hybrid languages (e.g., portunhol), creolizations and multilingual/translingual writing,  • the uses and functions of translation in established diaspora communities, both inside and outside the official boundaries of the Lusophone world (U.S., Canada, Hispano-America, Western Europe, South Africa, Asia et al.),   •  the multilingual experience of displaced populations, whether defined as migrants, exiles, refugees, asylum seekers, or any combination of the above institutional labels,    • transcultural communication in/between the 20th and 21st-century megacities of the Global South (i.e., South-South translation networks) in the development of alternative models of cosmopolitan ‘trans’-culture,  • translation in the development of emergent transnational identities (European Union, Mercosur, African Union, CPLP etc.),      • translational subjectivity and its relationship with both historical and contemporary discourses on race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, especially those associated with miscegenation, hybrid cultures and identities, feminism and queer theory,  • translation and anthropology, especially the use of translation and interpretation in ethnographical research of indigenous, native, displaced or otherwise endangered populations,    • translation and travel, whether tourism, humanitarian or missionary activity, cultural/educational  exchange or other forms of transcontinental movement,     •  translation and global conflict, particularly in the diffusion of Portuguese colonial rhetoric, anti-colonial resistance, as well as subsequent postcolonial theorizations and comparative analyses,    •   translations of short fiction, poetry and short academic essays from other languages into Portuguese, or from Portuguese into English, translations from non-Western languages spoken in CPLP countries or former Portuguese colonies are particularly welcome, above all those with accompanying essays by the translators that reflect upon the process of rearticulating these works within another language and cultural context.  Both longer articles (ca. 6000 words) and shorter pieces (ca. 3000 words) in Portuguese, English or other languages (subject to the discretion of the guest editor) are welcome.
