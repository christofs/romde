Master in Lingua, letteratura e civiltà italiana (Lugano)
           The University of Lugano (Switzerland) offers the fourth edition of the Master in Italian language, literature and civilisation (Master in Lingua, letteratura e civiltà italiana).  This master puts into practice what according to Gianfanco Folena is the historical essence of Italian in Europe (L'italiano in Europa, 1983): a language for art and civilization, able to give creative form to the civic foundations of our 'human heritage'. It proposes an interdisciplinary approach (language, literature, arts/history/civilization) and has invited lecturers from Switzerland, Italy, France and Germany, who themselves embody, throughout their research path, the parable of a &quot,language sweet and flavoursome, built with the sounds of solidarity&quot, (O. Mandelstam, 1933).
