           Visual Representations in Science: 6th European Spring School in History of Science and Popularization  The Societat Catalana d’Història de la Ciència i de la Tècnica is pleased to announce the   6th EUROPEAN SPRING SCHOOL ON HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND POPULARIZATION (Maó, 19-21 May 2011)  which will be devoted to Visual Representations in Science.  The School includes lectures by an outstanding faculty team: Nick Hopwood (University of Cambridge), Klaus Hentschel (Universität Stuttgart) and Daniela Bleichmar (University of South Carolina), and two workshops addressed to postgraduate students and young scholars aimed at producing a journal publication. We aim to prepare a set of the School workshop papers for consideration by Endeavour.  The School celebrates its tenth anniversary with the remarkable qualities which have characterized it as an exceptional forum with an international outlook, an informal atmosphere and the encouragement of discussion across disciplines and audiences with different levels of expertise.  Expressions of interest to participate in the School are welcome.
