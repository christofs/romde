Polonsky Postdoctoral Fellowships (Humanities or Social Sciences)
           POLONSKY POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS  The Van Leer Jerusalem Institute proposes to award two Polonsky Postdoctoral Fellowships, in any field of the Humanities or Social Sciences, for a period of up to five years, beginning October 1, 2011. The Fellowship offers an annual stipend of $40,000. Yearly renewal of the Fellowship will be contingent upon demonstrated progress in research. Fellows will be expected to be physically present at the Institute for consecutive years during the period of the award.  Although these are postdoctoral fellowships, other candidates may be considered in those fields in which a doctoral degree is not a prerequisite for career progress.  Candidates should submit the following documents in English to polonsky@vanleer.org.il: statement of research plans (3-5 pages, with title), summary of your previous research (3 pages), one published article or equivalent unpublished work, curriculum vitae, including list of publications, names and contact information for 3 possible recommendations. The deadline for submission of completed applications is February 1, 2011.
