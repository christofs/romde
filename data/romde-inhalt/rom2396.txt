MA bursaries in Italian Studies
           The Italian Department of the University of Warwick is offering three fees-remission scholarships to students on its MA for Research in Italian Studies, part of which is offered in collaboration with the Departments of French Studies, German Studies, and Hispanic Studies.   This one-year MA is meant for applicants who intend to continue on to PhD research. The Italian Department is able to offer research supervision in most areas of Italian Studies, from the medieval period to the present. The Italian Department at Warwick is among the strongest in the country for its postgraduate population and research profile. In the last Research Assessment Exercise it was ranked third in the country (second for research).
