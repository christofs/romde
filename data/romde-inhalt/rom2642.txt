Postdoktoranden-Stipendium: Villa I Tatti - Fellowships
           Postdoktoranden-Stipendium: Villa I Tatti - Fellowships  Villa I Tatti in Florence offers up to fifteen fellowships each academic year for advanced research in any aspect of the Italian Renaissance. Each Fellow is offered a place to study, use of the Biblioteca and Fototeca Berenson, lunches on weekdays, and various other privileges, the most important of which is the opportunity to meet scholars from a variety of countries working in related fields. The Fellowship is open to scholars of any nationality. On the average, over more than forty years of operation, about half the Fellows have been American and half from Europe and the rest of the world, though the proportion changes in any given year.  The Fellowship is post-doctoral. With the ongoing redefinition of doctoral programs in Europe this has become more complex, but in general applicants must have completed all the requirements of the Ph.D., the D. Phil., the dottorato di ricerca, or an equivalent doctorate at the time of application, including submission and examination of the thesis. Doctoral candidates who are planning a spring defense are thus not eligible. The diploma di perfezionamento from the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa is recognized as equivalent to a doctorate but not, in general, any other diploma di specializzazione.  However, the selection committee may decide to consider applications from candidates who have achieved scholarly recognition with the British M.A. or the Italian laurea as their final degree, if they are not enrolled in a doctoral program and do not intend to pursue a doctorate as part of their career path. Such exceptions will presumably be rare and will become rarer with time. The intent of the Fellowship remains firmly post-doctoral.  On the other hand, the Fellowship is meant only for scholars who are still in the earlier stages of their career, which may be defined, by an approximate rule of thumb, as the first decade after the doctorate.  Fellows are selected by an international committee of senior scholars in Italian Renaissance studies, representing such fields as literature, history, fine arts, music, philosophy, the history of science and the history of ideas. The committee meets in Cambridge, Massachusetts and makes its selections in mid-winter, applicants are generally informed of its decisions by the end of February.  The selection committee looks for demonstrable scholarly excellence and promise, requires a project of intellectual importance suited to the resources of I Tatti and Florence, and endeavors to assess the candidateÂ’s ability to contribute in a collegial way to the intellectual life of the other Fellows. Fellows are required to devote full time to their projects and may not have other obligations such as teaching positions, even part-time ones, during their fellowship year.  Projects do not have to be devoted to Florentine subjects, and often are not, but they must be on the Italian Renaissance and it must be possible for the greater part of the project to be accomplished in Florence. One of the goals of I Tatti is to establish an intellectual community in which a fruitful interchange of ideas can take place. Fellows are thus expected to spend at least two or three days a week at the Villa and to be in residence close by. Preference is given to scholars embarking on a new research project rather than to those who are continuing to work on the subject of their dissertations, applicants should thus describe both past and future work in their application.  The fiscal year for fellowships, as for all Harvard appointments, runs from July 1 to June 30. The full academic year begins in early September, and all Fellows are expected to be in residence from then until the following June, and to participate actively in the life of the center for the full period of their fellowship.  Stipends will be awarded according to individual needs, and a projected budget is requested from successful candidates at a later stage. Stipends generally do not exceed the $ 55.000 - $60.000 range.  Renewals or repeats of an I Tatti Fellowship are not granted.
