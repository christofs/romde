Code-switching in the bilingual child: within and across the clause
           The conference discusses current proposals on code-switching mainly in early bilinguals but also in adolescents and adults with different language combinations â€“ among them Italian, French, Spanish, English, German, Turkish and Chinese. The presentations are divided into three thematic blocks: CS at the clause level, CS at the NP level and the pragmatics and psycholinguistic aspects of CS in general.
