CfP: "Phonology, Syntax and Semantics of Creole Languages." International Seminar on Creole Languages for Postgraduates II
           The International Seminar on Creole Languages provides ample opportunity for  scholars doing research on creole languages to exchange ideas and debate current issues in the field. We especially invite post-graduate students at advanced M.A.,- doc- and post-doc level.  Each 3-hour session is dedicated to one specific aspect of creole linguistics. It will be moderated by an experienced researcher, who presents the main issues and critical questions from own research and leads the discussion with the participants.   The workshop makes it possible to share experience and expertise from own research and discuss problems with colleagues experienced in different Portuguese-, French, English- and Spanish-based creole languages.   This year's topics in the areas of Semantics, Phonology and Syntax focus on  descriptive approaches to creoles.   The conference language will be English.  Furthermore we are planning a poster session where anybody who’s interested is welcomed to present his own project or studies. If you want to join, please choose “I want to present a poster” on the registration form and don’t forget to mention the title of your poster.  Please forward this information to colleagues and friends and register by 30 June at the latest.
