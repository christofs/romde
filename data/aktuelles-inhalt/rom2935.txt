Society of Dix-Neuviémistes (SDN)
           With members from a dozen countries across the world, the Society of Dix-Neuviémistes is an international and diverse community of scholars. The SDN encourages interdisciplinary and comparative approaches to the 'long' nineteenth century (1789-1914) in France and Francophone countries, embracing linguistic, literary, historical, cultural and philosophical perspectives.  Our annual conference has provided a dynamic forum for scholarly exchange (including postgraduates), whilst our internationally-refereed journal 'Dix-Neuf' (&lt,http://www.sdn.ac.uk/dixneuf/index.htm&gt, and &lt,http://www.maney.co.uk/index.php/journals/dix/&gt,) has taken full advantage of recent developments in electronic software to enable a vibrant flexibility of delivery, access and presentation.  To join the Society, please complete a membership form (&lt,http://www.sdn.ac.uk/member.htm&gt,) and email it to the Membership Secretary as indicated. Payment can now be made: directly through PayPal at the click of a button, by cheque, or by Standing Order if you live in the UK. Members enjoy subscription to the journal and membership rates for conference registration, as well as receive the Society's Newsletter.   On behalf of our current members, the Executive Committee looks forward to welcoming you to the Society. All good wishes in the meantime, Bradley Stephens (SDN Membership Secretary).   ---------------------- Dr. B. C. W.
