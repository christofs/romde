Symposium in Honor of Abdilatif Abdalla on 5/6 May 2011 in Leipzig
           “Deep Language“ Crossing Borders: Exploring the Use of Culture as Resource in Political Activism and Resistance in Africa and Elsewhere Symposium in Honor of Abdilatif Abdalla on 5/6 May 2011 in Leipzig, Germany  The choice of language is inevitably connected to the purpose the specific language can serve. In political resistance the choice is particularly delicate. Although both, the speaker/writer as well as the situation towards which the resistance is directed are embedded in a certain cultural and therefore linguistic setting other languages or other modes of language might be required. What are the conditions under which cultural expressions, used as a means for resistance, can become accessible to an international community? What kinds of transformation processes are required to make local or localized symbolic orders accessible to a globalized public sphere in order to address the international community and thus gain support? Inherent in these questions is the assumption that those who are in need of support are the ones who have to overcome linguistic and cultural boundaries. While this seems to be a truism and a ‘fact of life’, it is exacerbated by the colonial heritage of a dependent language bias where it is felt that because ‘Africa’ constitutes ‘the other’ of the ‘West’, expressions in African languages are, in fact, in need of ‘translation’. What, then, does it take, that the international community is prepared to listen? How do activists with different backgrounds choose to moderate this balancing act between the local of expression and the global of solidarity?  Abdilatif Abdalla who was the first political prisoner in independent Kenya and who this symposium is to honor has perceived a more pressing purpose for his language use in political resistance from within Kenya: veiling the message. Using his cultural and social background of belonging to the patrician elite of urban Swahili culture, of being a mwungwana, he was able to counter the assault on his personal and political integrity during solitary confinement by writing poetry in Kimvita. The knowledge of poetry, and the ability to condense thoughts and topics by means of the rigid principles of Swahili poetry, leading to what also known as lugha ya ndani – ‘deep language’, is one of the cornerstones of being Swahili.  The symposium will give a voice to many of Abdalla’s friends and acquaintances including Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o who have worked with him, who know about the linguistic and cultural struggles involved in political resistance and who are looking forward to honor Abdilatif Abdalla.
